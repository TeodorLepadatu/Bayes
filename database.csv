Envy to other is swallowing me;Im from developingcountry, Indonesia , and for now i temporary work overseas for 3 years contract, it's a hard labor job, and stressful. Next year my contract is finish. But, during my stay here, because of job, and my social life, my depression got worse, and i envy this developed country. Why this country is so good. I can afford anything i want here. Why can't we just have equality in currency exchange? I I need to work 15-20 years in big company in jakarta(our capital city) , just to get equal amount of saving money from what i got from 3 years working here. Yes, that's right, it's saving money, not spending money. And yes, im going to be a rich person in such young age If I think about it, this society is sick, the gap of un equality beetwen developing vs developed country, or the poor vs the rich is too big right now. Sorry if i look like an evil person , but because of this,I almost wish for war to happen, or this world to end, and got reseted. So everyone can have another chance to gain equality, the poor can finally have a chance to have a better life. Because if this world order stay this way, it will eventually collapse on itself. Soon.;Envy to other is swallowing me Im from developingcountry, Indonesia , and for now i temporary work overseas for 3 years contract, it's a hard labor job, and stressful.

Nothin outta the ordinary. Paradise. Job stress. Life stress. (F bombs call_me_hand_medium-light_skin_tone beyond this point) read on;Um hello ....well many can relate im sure. After today I’m convinced I’m a misanthrope. Kinda ironic cause here i go again trying to get support from others. I’m on my way to being a “construction specialist” really I’m just an asskisser. I’m below everyone. No one respects me because they think I’m doing better than they are when really i respect everyone even though I know 100% they’re doing a lot better than me. One more loose screw right there. I mean fuck ME, man. I mean I’m not getting paid that much. I drive a company vehicle. I work hard. Very very hard. I’m being micromanaged. I’m in charge of a lot of people and projects but as far as work...I think we kinda get in the way of trades doing the actual work. I hate this business. Im sure I’m”ADD” but nobody cares. It’s still my fault I mess up. People are like crabs in a bucket. I just told the painter to fuck off. I told an old guy in the parking lot to fuck off. Recently Ive moved states. Been 8 months. I can’t or don’t get a new state license so I can actually move forward. I work too much. My car is in need of repair. I bought a motorcycle which I can’t ride legally. I’m living in a house that isn’t mine. I’m staying in a nice place with an awesome view by myself. House sitting and paying them a decent amount of rent while the owners are outta town...that’s about to end in a few weeks. Hard to keep up. Social life is super super lacking and dull of course. . First time moving away on my own. Sucks when Everyone is telling me what to do. And I do it. There’s a lot going on. Exact words to the painter who was complaining about my handy work (since it’s not my job/not my specialty which I blatantly spelled out to them....is ironic considering my soon to be former position) the exact words were “ quite frankly......I. Don’t. Give. a. FUCK. I’m this close to ...” and I just shook my head and he understood right away. Either I was having a mental breakdown, burnt out or that he needed to shut his trap before I shoved that paintbrush where the sun don’t shine. As for the old man. I was driving with expired plates because I had to do some side work on the weekend and I couldn’t drive my work truck because it has a company logo. So I can’t even flip people off anymore! I explained this to the guy. Been working 60 hour weeks none stop. Happened to have work I couldn’t refuse right on the weekend so I had to risk going out again with this vehicle. I’ve been pissed off at retirees lately since I’ve done a lotta work for them in this nice area. I usually have respect but I get fed up with sucking up to people that act like toddlers. Once he took out his phone to take a pic of my license plate, I got out and asked if he was retired? He said ....yeah I am. And looked him in the eye and said “then fuck off! Go find something better to do.” He eventually left saying have a good day. But I’m just so fuckin DONE with people and myself and the world. I just don’t know how this is gonna go. It’s an ever narrowing tunnel. For ALL OF US. I mean To add to it, I lost/spent all my savings so far (not much but very much needed at this point 2 grand and then some) on fuckin online dating and scammers and complete incompetence/desperation on my part. So yeah. Don’t know what to do or where to go...options are “endless” but I keep thinking a giant meteor would simplify that quite nicely don’t you? Don’t expect anyone to actually read this all the way through or even give a shit. Or what I expect you to type. Hopefully someone relates or even chuckles like “yeah that’s me” I don’t care. I just gotta know someone else will read this and potentially understand than just let this sit and stew inside me. I’m just venting. So Say hello internet.

Almost 49 and the chasm of emptiness has never been greater;I’ve been diagnosed severe bi polar where you no longer even get the good manias They just manifest as agitation or rage. After 32 years of fighting this shit I know there can be only one end. I’ve tried everything except DMT or psychedelics but why would that help Unless you can live in that realm for a majority of the time. I’ve always known it would never get better because there is just no way to overcome that the ROI on life is an investment no one would ever make it given the choice.;Almost 49 and the chasm of emptiness has never been greater I’ve been diagnosed severe bi polar where you no longer even get the good manias They just manifest as agitation or rage.

Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood?;I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over. I just have a pit and emptiness in my stomach that I don’t see going away long-term. 4 years ago, my mom killed herself, and I found the body. Safe to say, my childhood was a shit show of fear, emotional manipulation, feeling like a parent to my parent, despair, fighting etc. I live with my dad and sister now. My dad is a really nice guy, but has ZERO emotional intelligence. The other night, I was crying and screaming to him about how I wanted to kill myself and some other problems, and all he did was look at me with a blank expression and say he would call the police. He says he is worried about me, but I have never once felt emotionally conncected to him. I feel empty. My psych told me I have disorganised attachment style which Is apparently the worst. Coupled with the fact that I hate myself like poison and don’t think I deserve that to change, the future doesn’t seem very bright. On top of that, I think I got my mum’s good old depression gene. It seems my life is on a trajectory that is all too familiar. I feel as though I and floating in space, all alone, unable to connect to anyone because of what I’ve gone through. I am far more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my social circle, so while I’m always helping them, I have no one to begin to help me. Interactions are fun, but always empty. Everything is empty. I have no rules or discipline at all. Never have. Don’t care enough about myself to create it for myself. That’s my rant.

I convinced myself I was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks. Then I walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful, loving family. Now I cant stop crying;I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them.

Ive decided to get admitted to a hospital instead of just killing myself;Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem.

I’m doing well, but not feeling well.;A reflection. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. I’m in my 40s, in a middle managemnet position and am finishing up my first semester of graduate business school. I’m happily married and my husband loves me. All my needs are met financially. I’m doing well in all of these areas of life, exceeding even. But I’m also struggling deeply. I can’t sleep. I feel sick sometimes. I’m exhausted. I can’t wind down. My social life is nonexistent. I love my job. I love school. I get a high from both. But the relentless demands are killing me. It literally hurts when i try to relax. It makes me want to go be an Amish or something. Is this just life? Do I need to suck it up and be grateful for what I have? I believe all things worth having are worth working for. But I’m scared I can’t cut it.

Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.];"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life.

I'm not lazy at school, I just need some understanding is all.;I have to go back to physical school tomorrow and I dread it. School is one of the reasons I wanted to die. I'm particularly good at maths but my memory is so awful I can't remember anything at all and that's how I score so less in exams. I'm traumatized of ever getting anything average because of the times I've been beaten by my parents or punished or have the one thing taken from that motivates me to even get up. I don't even have access to means of killing myself. I can't jump off a building because I live in a short building. Tried choking myself but I bailed out at the last second. No pills to OD on and I'm too weak mentally to slit my wrists. I'm so socially awkward, I constantly disappoint those around me and I feel terrible. It hurts. I wish I could just have a job that didn't require me to be smart. I'm not. It doesn't help that I also have ADHD and the shortest attention span. I cannot concentrate on anything. So tomorrow I go back to school and none of my notes and assignments are done and I barely know anything. Can't wait to get a complaint from my teachers and get the shit beaten out of me again. Before you say to call the cops or anything on my parents....I can't...I love them too much. I'm too mentally weak to do anything to hurt anyone. Idk why I am like this. If you read this, I'm sorry.

Please tell me it gets easier;Hi all. I am two years into my career with a new mortgage. I live out in the suburbs in a townhouse. I make $83K per year and my mortgage payment is $1,450 with $250 HOA fees and utilities.... etc. I probably should have decided on a smaller place or continued to rent. I feel like I am in over my head sometimes with the bills I need to pay. Work stress + living alone for the first time + stress on staying on top of payments. I just feel in over my head and so stressed. I still have recurring subscriptions that I have not cancelled that I am being charged monthly fees for. I just need support and I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I never learned how to budget very well growing up and I feel like I am drowning. Any tips or words of support welcomed. I just feel so alone and overwhelmed. Thank you.;Please tell me it gets easier Hi all. I am two years into my career with a new mortgage. I live out in the suburbs in a townhouse.

Screen Time Negatives;I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone. Now I’ve extended this late night indefinitely as I labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens. Who’s with me? nerd_face ;Screen Time Negatives I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers.

I just realized that I believe that if I'm not constantly under a lot of pressure, I won't perform well.;In pretty much every aspect of my life. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, I always find a way to psyche myself out. It's pretty exhausting and I want to stop. I feel like in a way, I have an addiction to it. ;I just realized that I believe that if I'm not constantly under a lot of pressure, I won't perform well. In pretty much every aspect of my life.

23yo Male. Losing my best friend;I have lost who I considered my best friend. She told me that she never really cared about me and that she didn't care about losing me. Whenever I tried to spend time with her she made excuses to me and recently I have learned that it was all lies. She knew that she was the only person I trusted and she knows everything about me, and yet she hasn't minded seeing me hurt. I don't know if I can trust someone again. Really now I notice that I have no one. I just needed to express what I feel. I only want to die. ps I've been with depression and generalized anxiety disorder since 2017;23yo Male.

I (16M) might be clinically depressed?;"I (16M) don't understand if I am just feeling extremely anxious or am I depressed. It's not like I am getting suicidal thoughts or something. I am just not feeling okay(?) I have no Idea how to describe it but I am getting that ""feeling"" in my gut/chest. You know, the one you get when you receive some upsetting news. It has been fairly constant throughout the past 1-2 months. I read that depressed people do not experience emotions but I am experiencing them but if I am left alone I go back to being anxious or upset. I have kept myself busy for the past one month by studying, YouTube, Reddit, anything... I do not want to see a Psychiatrist, nor do I want to talk to my parents about it. They both are MDs but I think they won't understand. I do not want to share my problems with them and put just another burden on them... Also, I think I can pinpoint the cause of this depression I just want to know if these were the symptoms anyone has experienced when they were depressed?";"I (16M) might be clinically depressed?

Losing Streak;I feel like I'm really close to the end of my rope. I can't remember the last time I've caught a break, it's just been shitty news followed by more shitty news. Things dont get better, but sometimes after a few days of wallowing I'll feel just a shred of tranquility in my life, just for it to get yanked out from under me. At this stage even the littlest things just throw me off the edge and I'll spiral back into all these dark thoughts. I just feel like I'm broken and I dont belong in this world. idk i just want this pain to end;Losing Streak I feel like I'm really close to the end of my rope.

So stressed out it’s become a multitasking event;I’ve just noticed recently. I’ve got so much random stuff I’m stressed about my mind can wonder and stress out while I’m doing other stuff that normally kept my mind occupied. The most annoying is listening to music, and I don’t mean as background noise. Music used to be a good escape. Now I got a full blown rap coming out of my mouth as fast as it can move and simultaneously have my head stressing out in detail with what ifs about something I need to do tomorrow. Some of my work has a lot of numbers and data entry to it. I can be waist deep in numbers typing away and my mind is stressing out about something stupid in full detail again. I don’t even hold conversations while I’m doing my data work cause I know I’ll mess it up and I can’t focus on both but I can hold an entire conversation in my head and do it somehow. It’s so annoying I have no where to get peace now.;So stressed out it’s become a multitasking event I’ve just noticed recently.

End of Semester;Ah!!!! I’m almost done with this semester. I got all A’s except for one class that I’m hoping will bump up to a B since it’s so close. I managed this semester pretty well, however my teaching class is the one I’m worried about. There’s still so much to do and the last day to turn in material is Monday. (12 assignments plus the final exam) Just wanted to do a mini rant. Wish me luck loudly_crying_face ;End of Semester Ah!!!! I’m almost done with this semester.

School during Covid sucks;I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students. We just had midterms this week and it was fucking hell. I studied all week, barely slept and ate, and I’m just so tired of it all. Not to mention we have psats in a day and none of the teachers or even my parents said anything to me. I have extracurriculars that take time and I don’t know how to do anything right anymore. I’m just tired and stressed all the time and it’s in a cycle that just keeps going. I’m only in highschool and I already feel like my life is falling apart. I can’t seem to focus and I can’t seem to get anything done on time. I’ve lost all motivation to do school work. I used to love school and seeing my friends and now I’d rather fucking kill myself than deal with this anymore. But then I feel bad because I know there’s people with a lot worse problems than me so I’m sorry if I made anyone feel annoyed that was not my intention. I’m just tired and I need to get all this tension out.;School during Covid sucks I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students.

Please i need a break so badly;Shits been rough. Looking back at the last 10 years all I can think is, why couldn't I just fucking chillllll I ran full speed into every bad decision, made every wrong choice. Every life lesson I've learned I learned the hard way.. and am still paying for all of it. I basically threw it all out the window. All the important things. Education, Family, Freedom. No education, betrayed family, I'm dependent on the government and kindness of a coworker to support my 2 little boys and myself, my job doesn't pay the rent to say the least, but I've got not qualifications, no ged or hs diploma. I guess my point is I'm so stressed and I need a break so badly. I'm tearing up writing this part, ugh. Anyway.. Im not religious but I beg god to give me a break dozens of times a day. But I don't think I deserve a break. I think I deserve to feel this pain and worry after hurting all the people who cared about me so much, and making bad life decisions leads to consequences.. now I'm living with my consequences and it's so horrible..I just want to scream and cry. But instead I go under the blanket like now, write down my thoughts and try to breathe it out and think of good things I can do to fix it. I need to study I need to get my ged certificate I need to find a job I need to get my license I need to move somewhere with good schools I need to create a stable life for my boys before struggling is all they can remember.;Please i need a break so badly Shits been rough.

Trying medication again/A needed ramble;Hi I’m new here. I’ve battled with depression for maybe 15 years? Or more I don’t even know. The last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with Covid. I’m honestly sick of hearing about covid. My grandmother died a year ago and I feel like that’s when things made a turn for the worse. Her death was horrible. It wasn’t sudden but it wasn’t expected. Her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and I had to watch everyday for two months. It was traumatizing. My anxiety had become so unbearable I reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed Prozac which I had used before and it helped. This time it helped but then I found it started making me incredibly angry and worse. So I went off and tried to just deal with it. Because there are good days where I do feel fine. But then it started happening again so I reached out to a psychotherapist. She helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood I had so now more trauma has been brought up. I feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well. Like working night shifts(which I should be getting off soon hopefully), a renovation to our only bathroom that started in April and still isn’t done.. body image issues like crazy. I have 1 friend but I try not to vent to her because I hate being so negative all the time. Friends are so hard to make for me. Anyway I have a lot going on. I made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist. While my husband just stood there and didn’t comfort at all. He actually just left the room as I cried in a ball. Anyway I’ll wrap this up as I should probably go to sleep in prep for work. Ugh.;Trying medication again/A needed ramble Hi I’m new here.

Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.;I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. But That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep.

I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.;Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.

Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.;To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week. First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad. I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this. Edit Thank you for the support everyone.

My symptoms 1,5 years after Burning out ( & getting Diagnosed with Fatigue Syndrome );Hey guys, So a while back I did a post about the symptoms to look for when fearing burnout is around the corner ( LINK IN THE END OF THE POST). It was quite appreciated, so thought I'd do a little follow-up on how it's been going to recover and later also talk about how I lived that caused the burnout. So I started with recording a video sharing all the symptoms I still live with more than 1,5 years after the crash. Not to make people feel sorry for me, but because I want you to realize that there REALLY is a COST to working 24/7. Even if it's super fun and you feel like you have all the energy in the world.

Am I Not in Control?;Does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way? Like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all. Your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy. In social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something. It's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything. I have a lot of stressors in my life, and I can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that I've become subject to these things. I've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than I thought I'm capable of. How do people function with high stress? How do you groom yourself to do that? I've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been;Am I Not in Control?

Could this all be stress from an exam?;Sorry for long post. 25M. The last month I have no clue what’s going on. It started with an internal hemorrhoid that seems to have gone now, but right after my bowel habits changed for the first time in my life. I’m not sure if I was constipated because I was still going in some fashion and it was soft. I also started to get back aches, especially in the lower back. My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it. I took a laxative after my exam and that relieved the back pain and trouble, but since I’ve had an on and off burning sensation in my stomach, lower abdomen, and even thighs at time. The thighs have gone but it almost feels like there is a tight rubber band around my waist at times with an uncomfortable burning feeling. I do have anxiety troubles but I’m in CBT and things have been awesome. My GP said IBS but blew it off, and another GI guy just said Colonoscopy instantly. I saw one more person this week and he gave me some antispasmodics to try first before any colonoscopy. What’s weird is since I talked to him yesterday, the last day and a half, my symptoms have been just about nonexistent. Can’t be a coincidence can it? I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?;Could this all be stress from an exam?

I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?;1;

One of the worst side effects of my depression is the brain fog, but I never see anyone talk about it.;I don't know if this is the correct term to use for what I am referring to, but I feel like I can't be living the same way most human do. The best way I can describe it is that I'm only using 1% of my brain lol. I used to be a smart and intuitive girl, but for the past couple of years it's like I have no idea what's going on around me, I can't remember anything, I feel so fucking dumb all the time, and everything feels blurry and confusing. I think I've been holding in too much and my body and brain are shutting down. That's my best guess. Edit Wow! Just wanted to say another thank you to everyone sharing their experiences here, I feel way less alone, and ashamed. I can relate to so, so many of you. red_heart ;One of the worst side effects of my depression is the brain fog, but I never see anyone talk about it.

The thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on Bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today.;I came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble. Not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but I’m happy we matched. We went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date. Fast forward a year later, he requested me randomly on Instagram. Which we had never shared with each other. I messaged him and the next week we were on a date. It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we’ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. It may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him. Last year before we met again he had a plan to move back East after college. This year, he stayed in my state with me. Just feeling super blessed and I know sometimes dating apps aren’t great, but sometimes you come across some great people.;The thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on Bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today.

Anyone else have semi-suicidal thoughts on a regular basis?;I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with.

For the first time in 4 years, I feel hopeful for what the future holds for me.;I've never really been hopeful for anything. And if I have been, it's never lasted for more than an hour. My expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment. This has worked well for me, with minimal hurt from hoping too much. But. I don't need to do that anymore. I don't necessarily know why, but since June, I've been looking forward to waking up every morning. Actually, I know why. It's because the belief that I had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong. Completely wrong. It's so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time. For the past few years, I've been wallowing in my depression. I feared death but at the same time craved it. So, as foolish as I was. I tried. Failed. And regretted backing out for about 8 months. Mainly because I was now on people's watchlist. I had a fear of pills for a while. Just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn. I would constantly lay in bed, stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me. So I acted impulsively. If I was gonna go. I was going to go out with a bang. I fractured my hand. Had a scrap with my Bastard of a Parent. Attempted. Planned another. But at the same time, I desperately hung on. I didn't really want to die. No one really does. A close friend of mine dragged me out. I will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me. She let me stay. And I've realized, her family is the polar opposite of mine. Calm and quiet majority of the times. Full of fun. Laughter. They don't raise hands or lace poison in their words. I didn't know that this was possible. For me to be happy for more than an hour. For me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed. Where my mental illness is not a myth. Where my feelings don't have to be locked away. I feel so validated and unconditionally loved. I want to start getting professional help. To better myself. I feel like with this. I can keep pushing forward. That I will keep standing up after falling down. No matter how many times that will be. I don't know why, but I feel happy to be here.;For the first time in 4 years, I feel hopeful for what the future holds for me. I've never really been hopeful for anything.

My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.;"A bit of background My sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme, we're talking cops at our door, constant trips to the hospital, alternate schooling and the whole lot. She needs 24/7 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times. I currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her. Me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress, and since I have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because I just sit and get angry about whats going on at home. Now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house, weve lived there for over 13+ years, been good tenants and always paid rent on time, he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell. Its all super illegal but thats a completely different story. We have 2 months to leave, our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices (we live in a big city) and landlords are ridiculous here, super scummy, they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application. Even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central. Ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister. She needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers, schooling and the lot, its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it. I drive and work fulltime I can go where ever I want. My mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid. I dont want to deal with them anymore, the constant violent out bursts, the screaming and crying, everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress. I had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work. The dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot. Now when I suggested going our seperate ways to my mom I offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent I could spare, it ended with her screaming and crying that I was abandoning her. This makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more. What route do I take? I know moneys already very tight for her and I love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and I want to grow as a person and live my life. Tldr; my family struggles with mental health and I have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need.";"My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.

going insane over politics;I AM STUCK IN A HOUSE WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS. I live in the Midwest, and I’m a senior in high school, and I can’t fucking wait to get the hell out of this suffocating place. And I can bite my tongue and handle my immediate family supporting Trump most of the time. But I just can’t fucking do it anymore. I just can’t. I broke tonight at the dinner table and slammed my hand on the table and yelled at my brother. I was talking, having a conversation about how I wasn’t comfortable going out to a restaurant because of COVID, and he rolled his eyes at me and said “Oh my God.” And I screamed “WHAT” back at him and put my dishes away and went upstairs. Now I’m in trouble for screaming. I fucking hate it here. I’m full of rage and anger and I can’t go for a drive because my car is broken right now. I needed to vent.

College Student;So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do. Im Turing 21 in a couple of months and now just had a realization that no this is not what I want to pursue, so I applied to switch my major. Thankfully, the 32 credits can be applied towards the degree. However, Im turning 21 I feel like others around me have accomplished so much, and completing their degrees. Its just so overwhelming, and I feel like now my whole life timeline has been completely thrown off. Im back at square one with 4 years of college to go. I feel so stressed out.;College Student So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do.

Today I got invited to a wedding and was told I was the reason they met!;I’ve been on a bit of a downer recently but this has made me so happy! I spend a month every year in South Korea. Back in 2019, I planned a trip to the coast for just myself but decided to invite a friend of mine. She asked me if she could make it a big trip and bring 15 people I’d never met before. I said yes because I love meeting new people and I love the international community in SK. I booked 2 earlier extra days just for myself so I was there Thursday- Monday and she booked a 15 person house in the same airbnb right by my room for Sat-Monday. So I went and enjoyed two blissful days sat on the balcony and walking around the coast. On the saturday they all arrived, 2 different groups of friends my friend had got together to come down. We all had a wonderful time meeting each other, having bbqs, playing games, watching the sunset on the ocean etc Well today, I got a message on FB from a couple I met there. She was asking me to join their wedding via zoom and told me that they actually met on that trip. They wanted me, someone they’d only met for 2 days, to be at their wedding, because I was the one who had helped them meet! I am just so so so thrilled!!! I thought they already were together on that trip, I had no idea! I’m just super happy and can’t wait to witness their happy day.;Today I got invited to a wedding and was told I was the reason they met!

I have been self harm-free since February and I’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy.;I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help. Edit Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone.

Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help. Edit Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing.

A black sheep in the family.;I know I am the black sheep in the family because I've always been different. DIfferent in the way I behave, different in the way I do things. I'm very reserved and don't like talking much however, no one in my family is like this. I've also got in a lot of trouble as well due to me trying to my own self and different. A lot of people outside have told me 'why am I so different?' Moreover, I been told off a lot about not trying to fit in the family. I always tell myself how I am a black sheep and bring a bad vibe to my family line and also have the tendency to bring bad things with me. A lot of times I say why I was picked instead of someone else. I've never done anything to make anyone genuinely proud of me as I'm such a waste. In black sheep in my family, the person photoshopped in the pic to be there by false.;A black sheep in the family. I know I am the black sheep in the family because I've always been different.

I want to get help;Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends. Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help? Thank you.;I want to get help Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends.

I almost killed myself today;I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me. Edit I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management. To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that. I know but I’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life.;I almost killed myself today I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out.

Even if friends were there to celebrate it with me I just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy.

I just realised today that I have paid off half of my credit card debt;I’ve had this debt for nearly 3 years now, and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it. Over the last 1.5 years though I have been slowly chipping away at it and steadily paying about £21 a month, it’s not much but my financial situation hasn’t been great. Today I have gone to pay my bill and discovered that I have actually paid half already. Plus my financial situation is only improving this year, and hopefully I will soon be able to pay it off completely. Which then means I can start using it responsibly to get my credit score back up, while I save and then be able to get a good rate for a mortgage in a few years time.;I just realised today that I have paid off half of my credit card debt I’ve had this debt for nearly 3 years now, and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it.

How to get out of the habit of stressing;"Hi everyone, I have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed. From the minute I open my eyes, to the minute I close them I am constantly ""doing"" things and feeling like I am a few steps behind. So for me it seems like an ingrained habit that I sort of deault to constantly. Does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being? I do meditate, yoga and those kinds of things but even that can sometimes be a stressful ""must"". Any thoughts would be much appreciated!";"How to get out of the habit of stressing Hi everyone, I have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed.

Balance;I'm struggling lately with managing my heart and mind working in harmony when presented with stress. Where I'm sure in my decisions with with a handful of my most recent stress inducing situations, and how I handled them.. the discordance in others is stifling and I'm not sure how to handle things. The upset causes my emotions to muddy my decisions, and vice versa- and stress seems to be a catalyst in all of it. It's taken its toll on me over time, and I'm worried about damage it's caused, or is causing. Reaching out here to ask how others have found they best handle their own stress and stressful situations? I'm trying to pick up more healthy methods of coping on my own. Thanks.;Balance I'm struggling lately with managing my heart and mind working in harmony when presented with stress.

"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion";"Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up.

Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?;I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out. Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health. I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite. Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better” Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break? Edit you guys are really sweet and this made my day, thank you;Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better? I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year.

How I lived which eventually made me burned out & get diagnosed with fatigue syndrome;Hey, I'm doing some videos where I share my burnout & fatigue syndrome journey. In my latest, I talk about how my life looked like prior to burning out. Shure, it got more intense the last six months before hitting the wall, but in reality, it started ten years earlier when I started studied to get a master's degree in engineering. In short. I kept myself busy ALL the time. I didn't particularly feel that stressed out, I know the 'bad' kind of stress which just cause a tremendous amount of anxiety, and that wasn't very present. But always being 'ON' and just putting in too many work hours per week without any real 'OFF' mood, I think is what eventually broke me.

I cried for the first time in years;The last time I cried before this was around 5 years ago when my dad passed away, this was when I was 14. This time the reason is also a sad one but not related too someone passing away. I think it was an accumulation of not feeling understood, stress for my exams and the realisation that even if I talk to my mother (the only living relative I still have/live with) she can't understand what I'm feeling/going through. We talked for so long and literally 5 minutes later it looks like she forgot all we talked about and continued minimising everthing I said and felt. Afterwards I just walked away and the tears just came.

I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.;Just like the title says I am 58 M. I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to...... Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er. The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through. BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State. Have a good day. ;I am 58 M.

Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State. Have a good day. ;1;

Worst night yet (long rant);I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it. For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!! I cant fucking deal w this anymore but if I give up on school then I'll be even more stressed if such a thing is possible;Worst night yet (long rant) I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it.

I don't even know why I'm depressed;I've been in an endless cycle of momentary happiness and a deep hard drop for so long now. I don't even know why I'm depressed anymore. Most of the things in my life that have kept me down I feel like I've made peace with. I miss feeling happy, like genuine happiness, not where I suppress my sadness and force myself to be happy and put on a brave fave in front of everyone. I had a girlfriend and whenever I tried to talk to her she told me it wasn't her problem and that she couldn't help me (not in so many words but yeah). Now she's gone and I'm doing better cause I have some friends to talk to but that hasn't helped either. I find myself falling again, losing motivation again, feeling like ending it all again. I've contemplated suicide multiple times but I haven't taken the leap just yet. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It seems like I'm only ever happy when I do drugs but I don't have the money for that and I already recovered from an addiction once and I can't fall into one again. Idk why I'm typing this but last time I posted on a subreddit, typing out my feelings really helped. I feel like me not knowing why I'm depressed makes me more depressed and it just keeps getting worse.;I don't even know why I'm depressed I've been in an endless cycle of momentary happiness and a deep hard drop for so long now.

Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up;"EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat. Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.";"Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can.

Dealing With A Stressful Situation When All Alone;;Dealing With A Stressful Situation When All Alone nan;1;
Money, Games, Nonsense;So I stress about the worst stuff (Things I shouldn't be stressed about) I have recently spent $300 on a roleplaying game for deluxe cars and I'm now starting to regret it realising that I might not stay on that server for less than a year so I'm thinking to myself what was the point I just put $300 in the trash because since they are my only friends and they leave then I would be alone and wouldn't want to stay in that server and then I wouldn't be able to savor the cars that I spent $300 on. I'm also stressing about the same server, I only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year, so I want to spend as much time with them as I can same thing for the $300 I spent. I had to decide to get a job (In game) and wanted to be a police officer which I thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which I realised from one annoying guy so I wanted to quit and be a prison guard which isn't that much of a fun job but I would be with my four friends who work together there. My dad (IRL) told me that I shouldn't quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life. I stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore. I love this server and I want to continue playing on it. I have vowed not to use that much money a game ever again, which is already a start but what has been done is done and I've decided to work with my friends even if the job isn't that cool (cause I want to spend time with them), but I still can't stop stressing about all of it.

Labeled as mature for being apathetic;At a young age I was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions.

I am so excited to move to my new hometown;This day is finally in sight and I’ve been waiting for years and it’s finally here! I am finally leaving the ghetto shithole where I’ve suffered and been depressed and wanted to die for 18 long hard years and moving to a resort town of 1500 people near a beautiful beach. My new hometown is away from all the filthy smog in the city, and overall the attitude of the people is miles ahead of my old place. No longer will I be blankly stared at by losers and degenerates. Nowadays I will be waved at and have pleasant conversation with my refined gentlemanly and ladylike neighbours. Now I can safely go for walks to a quiet park that’s not filled with disgusting people and not have to worry about some asshole’s untrained pit-bull or Rottweiler going nuts and attacking me. I also can walk in peace knowing that there aren’t any dipshits driving full speed while having horrible music on full blast. I can hear the birds singing, there’s ample forest that I can likely go hunting in, and I think my romantic and sexual mating chances are very high since there’s lots of beautiful beach babes down a few blocks from my house p. I am so extremely hyped to move there, I’ve been depressed and felt unwelcome long enough. Now it is time to live the high life and embrace my true happy self that’s long waited to truly show. Special thanks to everybody who’s helped me at least survive through the doldrums, you all know who you are. This is straight up one of the best things to ever happen to me ever, period. I am thrilled beyond belief. ));I am so excited to move to my new hometown This day is finally in sight and I’ve been waiting for years and it’s finally here!

Can't afford university;University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby). This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account. Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system. I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date. Thanks to anyone reading this far.;Can't afford university University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed).

Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.;"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.";"Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.";1;
Why do I have to do this?;Most of the time I'm in a good mood, of course I have bad and good days, but sometimes there are those days when everything seems so pointless to me and the pressure just overwhelms me, where I wonder why?

Should I tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress?;About 2 years ago, I started having terrible stomach pains all the time, which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that I faced throughout the day. Last year, my father became very worried about this, and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it. My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain. After I explained the situation a little more, he told me that my issues were definitely stress related, and that I should visit a psychiatrist. He also advised me to start taking therapy. I actually used to take therapy for something other than stress. I had been regularly engaging in self harm, and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started. So when my father found out, he asked me to start taking therapy. It worked great, and I loved going, but I think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive. My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities. My father started getting paid around $20,000 more per year after the move, and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable. A few months ago, my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away. But I knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it. I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do. So I started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I thought I would be able to keep up the lie, but the pain seems to only be getting worse.

So very happy and excited that I still can’t sleep, and I’m completely exhausted!;Just before the Great Panini began, SO and I moved from Orlando to upper southern Michigan. The plan had been to move to Grand Rapids after a couple of months. The panini turned it into 2 years. I sit here tonight in our hotel room 18 minutes away fro our new home, vibrating from the last round caffeine. We were in a smallish two bedroom while we both work from home. Tomorrow the first round of our belongings will be dropped off at the new place. I will have my own office! SO gets an office/lab, and a two car garage. If the whole thing felt real, I would weep with joy. Instead, it’s edibles and maybe sleeping med.;So very happy and excited that I still can’t sleep, and I’m completely exhausted!

Wish I could cease to exist.;Everyone near me would be better off if I wouldn't be around anymore. They might say they love me, but I'm mainly just a burden. My body aches more and more each month and and I just wanna quit. Alas, I am too afraid of dying to actually do anything. And so I keep on living in spite of it all... hating myself for being a useless coward. Just wanted this off my chest.;Wish I could cease to exist.

i don't believe in love anymore;i have such a hard time connecting with most people... and I thought I connected with somebody who was finally on the same wavelength as me and of course, they ghost me. I know what you're going to say, you have plenty of time and there's plenty of people out there. But the thing is there isn't. I know what I want and what I need and most people can't give it to me, so I rarely date. I've lost hope in finding love and I don't believe in soulmates or any of that bullshit anymore because nobody in this day and age believes in it anymore they just want to talk to you for a little bit and then move on to entertain someone else. i don't care. i literally don't care anymore.;i don't believe in love anymore i have such a hard time connecting with most people... and I thought I connected with somebody who was finally on the same wavelength as me and of course, they ghost me.

Stress at work;We all have stress at work right? It’s not like I am a doctor or run a billion dollar company. It youth sports.. 60 hours a week (even when I had Covid) I have a second interview for a new job. But is the grass any greener on the other side? I would be giving up the following. 1. 4 weeks vacation 2. Freedom to plan my schedule 3. 7 years experience 4. Basically unsupervised I could get 1. 40 work week 2. More pay 3. Also a fast paced work place (not a positive thing) 4. Close to home. I am just so tired...;Stress at work We all have stress at work right?

I need help and I don't know how to get it.;At this moment in time I am coping with something. I feel so broken and have been crying all day. The stresses in addition whatever underlying problem I might have is really kicking my ass. I sought help twice before and the doctor hurt me a lot more than he possibly knew. He was focused on my sexuality. He insinuated that being gay was abnormal (not directly) and that I was feeling bad due to uncertainty. But that was never my issue and just made the years of shame in regards to my sexuality influenced by people around me become a lot more extreme. I don't know if I'm qualified or at the State of needing hospitalization but feel nonfunctional. I feel embarrassed and immense amount of shame. I feel like I failed at life. I don't have a family doctor but use walk in clinics. Should I be asking for a therapist, psychologist or any other specific doctor? I was having a rough time 2 weeks ago and the walk in clinic doctor was wonderful enough to help me relax. But I need to move forward. I don't want to be in this mental state. Fyi getting a family doctor is really difficult. I've been trying.;I need help and I don't know how to get it. At this moment in time I am coping with something.

Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever;I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly. I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will. I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me. And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them. But, it helped so much. Honestly. Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care. To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life. I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone. She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen. She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice. Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge. Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore. Thank you stranger. Now I’m gonna go binge movies and work.;Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

Idk if I should just end the relationship myself or give him the opportunity to say if he’s done or not.

I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?;I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma. Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine! About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it. And now I’m worried that my heart will give in due to stress. How do I get over it and stop stressing about stuff? ;I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?

Feeling trapped in endless stress;I work in an emotionally draining field of work and have struggled with anxiety my entire life. I’m at a point where I feel trapped, hopeless, and exhausted. I focus on simply making it through the week and find that the only thing I want to do is sleep. When something small goes wrong at work I feel like it pushes me over the edge and I’m ready to snap due to all the built up stress, anxiety and frustration. I often fantasize about breaking a limb or having a medical emergency that would prevent me from going to work.

Dealing with others Angers is Stressing me;Right now, at this moment I'm feeling very stressed and afraid because a lot of things in my life recently have happened, and i have come to the point where people always scream at me, people always explode in anger when I don't agree with them on or when we are in a disagreement and lately this is happening to me so many times in so many different situations I'm beginning to feel insecure and really stressed and traumatized by the reoccurring situations.

Stress from browsing the internet;So for the past few weeks I had stopped browsing online, and had put restrictions upon my self and my devices.

Does anybody else have a friend/or S.O. that is a good friend you've had a long time, but every text conversation usually ends up with you feeling drained, irritated, and in a really bad mood?;Alright I'll try not to make this super long ... so basically I have been really good friends with someone for like 5 years and is always there for me to turn to when I need his help and will do about anything that I may ask always has my back etc. I really value him and how he always helps me to not worry because he will never let me down...but I feel like every conversation, for lack of a more fitting word..that he is constantly cutting me off even before I get a chance to respond before he starts talking again dominating the whole conversation and bombards me text after text after text not giving me any time to reply to anything and if I do get a message in, it doesn't make much difference on what I'm feeling and trying to get across and it's only after he sends 4-5 texts before mine shows up in the thread before what I said was acknowledged and addressed and then after it's briefly talked about then he again just talks and talks and sends numerous texts in a row and won't fucking shutup until I get to the point of overwhelming anger taking full control over me and then I end up having an anxiety attack that doesn't end for at least 30mnz after I have cussed him out ,or attempted to and completely cut off wasting one more minute of time and quit the conversation for good feeling drained of everything and out of energy.

Beirut Explosion ended me;First off I'm a lebanese 24 years old and You can't imagine the life I'm living here. Our house got destroyed in the beirut explosion and my dad got injured. My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. My father is unemployed too. We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago.

My insights on my stress and how I handle it.;I'm recovering of a burn out and I'm learning more about myself. **Measuring** I have noticed I've got 4 points where I can measure my stress - Physical - Mental - Emotional - My motivation and perseverance When I'm stressed - Physically I just get pains everywhere when my body is in stress. My muscles ache or problems with my bowel. - Mentally I have no concentration to do normal thinking, analysing or problem solving. Watching/reading/listen is just a no go. - Emotionally I cry often when an emotion pops up. I can't control my emotions, they take over. - My motivation/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, I can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things I want or need to do are just out of the question. When I'm in this fase I'm out. I just can sleep, I walk because I need to and I'm happy my parents provide me with food. **Making my own stress thermometer** I made a chart where I put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it - RED burn out tired_face - ORANGE stressed confounded_face - YELLOW minor stressed disappointed_face - GREEN peaceful relieved_face In every cell I put indicators. For example when I'm in yellow I can still watch a new movie, but not in orange, but usually not fully just about an hour. In orange I loose motivation. This way I can track my daily stress level. **Origin of my stress** I know I have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest. It feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness. Actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations. **How I plan to recover** I'm resting right now, I'm lucky I get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave. Daily I rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, I try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which I know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard. I'm mindful, I meditate and I'm very aware of my emotions. When they pop up I try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions. When they pop up when I need to make a difficult choice I choose rationally for my wellbeing. Rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional). Even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions I get not listening to my beliefs and expectations. I'm not helping anybody when I can't even do things for myself! After making a choices like this I get proud of myself because I choose me partying_face **Motivation and perseverance** I have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again grinning_face_with_big_eyes So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.;My insights on my stress and how I handle it.

After making a choices like this I get proud of myself because I choose me partying_face **Motivation and perseverance** I have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again grinning_face_with_big_eyes So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.;1;
I don't enjoy being... human;Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better. I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree). I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job. And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff. In my country there is a cult of working your ass off. If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor. Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all. I just hate being human.

Question;"This is relatively new to me. Over the past six month i have been very stressed. Though i have been experiencing something that is weird; i have been going to the toilet much more frequently, depending on the stress level. On some very stressful days i would have to urinate more than 12 times. Is that a stress related issue? Ive come to the conclusion that it is, since, ive done multiple tests and check ups to rule out any physical problems. Is anyone experiencing the same issue?";"Question This is relatively new to me.

Money and Mother;So today I’m stressing and having a painful headache. Today my whole family says I’m “codo” (Mexican street word of saying cheap) that it hurts for me to spend money on my mother. Which is half true it hurts but I at least give her something like right now I’ve been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when I bought her pans because she needed pans. But this week I failed for her birthday because i didn’t willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna (because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so I said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if I was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal) that my mom wanted. They say I’m cheap but I always buy stuff that my family likes even though yeah hurts me but if they want it I will buy it. Right now I guess this is me just to vent. I don’t know what to do to prove to my parents that I’m not cheap and that I have been buying stuff willingly for my mother. My father says I still have Mother’s Day and Christmas to do it correctly I guess. But for today my moms birthday I got her a necklace that said mom and a birthday card. It stresses me out because they say that I haven’t changed but I feel like I’ve doing very small baby steps in changing this bad characteristic of me but they expect me to drastically change because I guess it’s a habit that they never taught me to break at a young age. I don’t think I’m a penny pincher but I know it hurts when my bank account goes down but I mean I know my mom would do the same for me in buying stuff that I would like. I’m horrible with presents and sometimes I wish my mom could give me strong hints in what she wants and give me an idea what to give her. But can someone help out on how to change this habit and prove my parents I’m not a cheapskate on my mom for special occasions or when she is wanting them. And how can I be more aware on what she wants.;Money and Mother So today I’m stressing and having a painful headache.

I've lost my best friend;I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half. My best friend and boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me that we would be taking a short break for his mental health, I know how hard life can be and that his situation also sucked so I after many a tear went a long with it, even though I felt it was a little over board. I love this man with all my heart and soul and I hoped that he would be okay as I know his depression episodes get bad when not delt with quick and I was always there to help when available. After a few weeks I tried texting a few friends (one thing you must know about me is I'm not very popular and don't have many friends and just started at a new school) one friend helped me out the best they could but recently have just trailed off and left me here... during this time, not only was my family involved in so much crap on both sides but many a family member are sick, my car legitimately broke down, my phone broke itself, and I have no one who really is there for me. I'm all alone now... It feels so difficult to do anything, even get up. Now that I've lost my best friend in the whole world after going through so many other trammatic relationships (I was abused in 2 other relationships) I feel like a waste of a person. I feel like him saying he's coming back is a lie that he told me to maybe give me a false since of hope and happiness, but then again I don't know... I really want to believe what he's saying is true but it's almost been 2 months now. I really just feel like my feelings have been disregarded and that I'm always the one who cares the most about everyone, now that they're all gone I don't feel okay... I feel so lonely... I just want my best friend back...I know reddit is a strange place to go with this but I have no good options left and the people here seem like they're pretty chill. Anyways, that's my story...;I've lost my best friend I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half.

Feeling very stressed out lately?;Hi, i need to vent a little bit. I started a job at an Amazon Fulfillment center in November 2018. Anyways, I am at my wits end with this job. I am not really good at what I do their and they know that (I cant for the life of me pick 400 items an hour due to all the jams I get or pod gapping but its always my fault). I got sent home early two days ago because “i suck”. I even got asked if I like the job I have and the process assistant complained to me no matter how much they help out I dont improve. It hurts. Even though I moved out and have enough money to last until I get another job I have lined up I asked my mom her opinion on quitting but she tells me I should stay only because I need the health insurance until I can get on my fiancés in October (when we get married) then quit but she feels bad for me since I am going crazy. I should be working right now but the bus was too packed and skipped my stop( i dont drive). What should I do? Just quit? Listen to my mom?I know I need health insurance and the job pays well but like I said I am at my wits end with everything. This is the worst place I worked for. I know another place to apply for insurance thats near where I live(i already enquired information from them if I was to get that insurance) l, I already have another job I can get more days added until this other new job I am getting calls me for orientation class (they want to hire a few more people to have a full class) Im literally end up crying thinking about going in and I feel like quitting is wrong but like I said I cant take it no more.;Feeling very stressed out lately?

This shadowed figure, he follows me everywhere. I don't know if its a friend or a foe, But he is making my life a mess...He won't leave me alone.;"Since birth I have seen this...""**Figure.**"" It was as young as me and the more years I lived, the bigger it became and the more it learned. It was a black and grey figure, bright grey eyes, its arms thin with sharp claws, and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been. It appeared more frequently every passing day. I told people about it, but nobody wished to believe me. When I told people, they responded with ""*Well, does this 'thing' have a name? If its so real, it must have one.*"" Sadly, I didn't know its name, but one day I built the courage to ask it. I met it in a forest by my house, in private, I asked for its name and why it was always following me. He came close to me and spoke to me. ""*I go by many names,* ***Sadness, Despair, Depression.*** *But in your case, call me...****Autism****.""* Autism said he was connected to me since birth, an accidental life. Back then, I thought he was just a person nobody understood like me, so I let him stay with me. But now, Autism has almost ruined my life. He began forcing me to be different. Separating me from people I cared about and those who cared for me. I didn't believe I could save myself from him. He always held me close, trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones. He used them whenever he wished, and made me a puppet. Whenever he took me over I became ***Aggressive, Harmful, Dangerous.*** I always begged him to leave me alone, but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together. One day, I had had enough. I finally faced the shadow that took me over, and I ***reconciled*** with it. I knew it wouldn't leave, even if I told it to. I asked for it to try and change, to listen to me, to help me become unique, to help me be normal, not a monster, ***to make me a person.*** He stared back at me, and apologized to everything he had done, he had just wanted me to act his way. We spoke until we finally reached an agreement. I had thought my life was turning around. I was making friends, Becoming active, succeeding in school. Although he would return to his habits sometimes, he kept his word and had become a friend of my own. When I introduced people to him some weren't impressed, but most liked him and thought he was interesting. It was working out...until now... I had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life, because of the events the world is facing. But it ended up being the following year, 2021. My Mother had not been in the greatest of conditions. She was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides. She was getting better every day, to a point where we could take her back home. (She stayed on a hospital bed at the house though.) I was going to high school one day, when my step dad told me he had the Virus. We lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents, so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better, taking care of my Mother who was still at the house. My Grandparents told me we were going back to check on them, Autism was really nervous about what would happen, but I ignored him. We got there and we said hello to them. Then our stepdad told us the worst news ever, our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week. I was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen, I was already prepared for this, my brother wasn't as much. So today was the day we would say goodbye to her. I won't go into much detail about here, but when we left back to our Grandparents house. I went upstairs and saw Autism sitting on the bed, Sad. I tried to comfort him. Every time I was about to cry, he would tell me ""Crying will not help, its hard to keep the sadness in, but do not shed tears for anybody in front of anybody. It will only make it worse."" These events on my Mom have happened a few days ago, and is about to pass away.

I can't sleep at night anymore;So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any< I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works. ;I can't sleep at night anymore So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so.

I have no sleep.;Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly. But there was this project I had for the design course that took me the whole Christmas break to do. (I only had 2 weeks of that break) Since it was a plushie project, my teacher expects us to have a sewing machine at home. I didn't have one so I sew it all by hand. I would stay up until 6 am to work on it then wake up at 8 am to sew again, by doing all of that myself I pushed back all of my other units for my other course and now I have fallen behind a lot.. I would always make a schedule for my day but then I have interruptions such as how my mom would get mad at me for not getting my work on time then goes on to say she's gonna take my electronics away? IDK she's gonna make me fail either way if she ever does that again. Then I have a boyfriend that I've been with for a year and a few months now, in October 2020 he did a suicide attempt and I felt so useless not being there in person. Which of course I broke down, didn't do my work for the whole night, didn't eat anything, and when my mom walked into my room when I had my break down and she made a happy expression that I broke up with him. I told her about it and she didn't care and left my room. 2 hours later he was alive and well and I felt relieved but now I feel more paranoid that he would do that again. People say that taking breaks is good when you're stressed. But I can't take any breaks, I'm behind in my subjects and I only have this week and 3 more weeks until I have to move on to the next quadmester. After that, outstanding work from that unit will become a 0.;I have no sleep. Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly.

Managing stressful situations that are actually very important?;I have a company that deals with wholesale international trade. Anyone who has ever bought something online already knows how much things can get delayed. If your Amazon Prime toothbrush gets delayed a day, whatever shrug it off right? What if your girlfriend's birthday present is lost or stuck in customs? A little more frustrating right? Now what if your entire shipment of tens of thousands of perishable goods is a week late while all your competitors start getting theirs? That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about. It's easy to say just don't dwell on the things that are out of control. Don't ruminate on the problems and instead focus on solutions... Etc. But when it's a pretty impactful event in your life with potential long term consequences it's easier said than done. I mean logically, in theory having negative thoughts about said event does nothing to change the outcome. But am I really supposed to be able to act all Zen when I'm potentially going to be out thousands of dollars? Lost sales, damages reputation, potential lost customers, etc.;Managing stressful situations that are actually very important? I have a company that deals with wholesale international trade.

Exam season stress management;Tldr CBD eased my exam stress I'm a huge exam stresser, I get major anxiety and I feel like shit the weeks leading up to exams and finals.

How do you cope with spiraling? I need help;Everytime i think about work, i start to get blocked and start to spiral with anxiety. My brain just starts to get so stressed i start to get disturbing intrusive images that will make me go get distracted so i can stop having them, but that doesnt make any of my work disappear, so of course that will make me accumulate work and then have to either work for weeks without rest or have a breakdown and fail on my projects. When i overwork myself, its to a point where i will need to rest for several days after, which can make me go to the ''get distracted and avoid doing work'' phase because my brain just doesnt want to go through several days like that again.

Long, but need advice on money stress;My husband and I of 25 years want to move to Vancouver Island. His mom lives there and is not doing well.

We are posting items to sell online, people just aren't buying anything! We are waiting for the Small business grant to come and he applied for the extra 20k loan from the government but hasn't heard anything about that either.

Some years ago I had to drop out of school due to chronic fatigue. Cue life falling apart. Diagnosed with depression and some other mental health conditions. Depression and anxiety has controlled my life for as long as I can remember. Recently, I got the chance to go to a college, study art and basic subjects I missed out on. Literally the perfect chance for happiness, I could meet new people, study what I love. My anxiety once again fucked me and I failed to go. I have another chance for a place on the course next year, but a year is a long time when you have nothing to do all day and no one to talk to. Idek if I will make it to the next year at this rate.;Wondering if there's anyone here who has experienced the same as me, and managed to make a recovery and get their life together. The title.

Woman gets sexually assaulted at work. Nobody cares.;As described I am going through the worst disappointment of my life. A woman gave a Witten complaint to hr that one of the partners basically just did everything to her but pull his dick out. He also did the same to numerous other women. It’s covered up. I was told to relax. Everyone knows. Nobody is outraged. My fellow “feminist” colleague won’t even acknowledge it. The worst isn’t men perpetuating. It’s women approving of the actions and siding with men. I’m so fucked from this lately that I am barely functioning. I’m not eating or sleeping. I haven’t slept unmedicated in months. If I don’t take meds I am up til 5-6 without fail. Directly caused by this. Oh their solution? Yea they just moved his office next to mine. I hold pee in so I don’t have to go outside my door. I’m going to be quitting obviously in a few months and this will be fully disclosed to the stakeholders as to why. But my god. What the fuck. How’s this real life.

My 3 month hiatus after a mental breakdown is about to end;I've always been depressed/anxious for as long as I can remember, but this past year, my mental health has been at a severe all time low. I quit my really great job 3 months ago because I had a mental breakdown and literally felt like I was going crazy and couldn't handle anything at all. I've always been work motivated and have never not had a job since I was a teenager (I'm 30 now.) The last 3 months have been incredibly difficult to say the least. I've been seeing a therapist and I've tried 9 different antidepressants/antipsychotics in the last like 6 months. Nothing has helped. I sleep most of the day every day. I haven't needed hospitization thankfully, however my husband and I have definitely discussed the possibility of me needing to be admitted and there have been times that I was very close to going. I've had to have him hide my propanolol (I take as needed for panic attacks/anxiety) because I was suicidal and fantasizing about overdosing. I just started Trintellix (in addition to Lamictal) about 2 weeks ago. For the first week or two of taking most of the medications I've tried, it has always seemed to help at least a little bit. I'm assuming that's just a placebo effect because I want it to help so badly. But they always stop helping and I go back to my bedridden, severely depressed self. The last week or so, I've actually felt better than I have in the last few months. I'm not 100% of course and I still have a hard time getting myself motivated to do shit, but I actually feel like there is a possibility of me being able to get things done. I feel like there is a 150 lb weight on top of me instead of a 200 lb weight on top of me. I'm really, REALLY scared it's not going to last like all the rest of the medications though. Long story short, I finally got a job. A good one that I'm excited about. I start in 20 days. I'm looking back at the last few months and looking at how I'm feeling now. I really really want to start this job while feeling at least okay. I know that once the excitement of the job passes, the depression will probably creep back up, but I'm hoping it'll be at least manageable. I don't want to fuck it up and have to stop working again. I'm trying to think of ways I can prepare mentally before I start- what kind of habits I should try to start getting into ahead of time so I don't find myself too overwhelmed and unable to handle anything. I've been so severely depressed the last 3 months and I'm not going to be able to stay in bed all day when I start this job. It's going to be exhausting if I don't make changes now.

Do people still use stress balls and the like to relieve stress?;I deal with an extreme amount of stress on what seems like a daily basis. When I was younger, I remember that I was given a squishy stress ball that I could squeeze in my hand for when I was in special help for my ADHD. It helped ground myself a little and I'm thinking it can help me in moments of extreme stress. Does anyone still use stress balls or similar equipment? Do you recommend using them, and what do you use? Edit minor clarification;Do people still use stress balls and the like to relieve stress?

Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?;For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first. My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me. My doctor’s visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately, they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral. I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal part-time money to pay for whatever else. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked up by my parents. I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?;Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor? For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first. My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me.

Stressed and overwhelmed;I’m sorry this is a ramble.

I'm becoming worse by the time passes, I can't think, remember, focus, relax. I want to solve this problem but I can't get out of this situation and I'm about to explode. I have 2 weeks to work on a lot of responsibilities but I don't have any strength in myself anymore. When I have time in my hands I can't work anything neither I can have fun by doing my favourite activities. It stops me living in the time, I literally can't do anything because I can't think anymore. Otherwise I don't feel I'm under heavy pressure, I became so numb.

Not sure how to keep going;"Lately, I'm so depressed and I have times where I can't feel any happiness about anything. I cant feel hope. I want to die sometimes, but really I can't because who would take care of my pets? I can't let them down that way. But going on feels so bleak. And it's hard. The biggest issue at the moment is my boyfriend and I. When we started dating, we both had sex with other people and we were both fine with that. I guess you'd call us ""swingers"". The people I had sex with didn't get along with my boyfriend. They started avoided me and I didn't get almost any sex anymore, while my boyfriend still did. This upset me. I felt like it was unfair. My boyfriend pointed out he's not the easiest to get along with and he warned me this might happen when we started dating. Finally, I said I wanted to close our relationship because it didn't feel fair anymore. Now there's a ton of resentment on both sides because we both feel like the other ""ruined"" what we had. I don't know anymore. All I know is, the closeness isn't the same, I feel like crap, my body image is terrible because all these guys used to love having sex with me and then all the sudden no one wanted to anymore. My self esteem is rock bottom. I keep second guessing- was it wrong of me to close the relationship? But I know I was miserable before. Thing is, I'm still miserable now. This is all exacerbated because a lot of my friends were couples who I had sex with. Then, when all this happened, those friendships dissolved. And I moved to live with my boyfriend a year ago when I lost my parents, so most of my non lifestyle (swinging is often referred to as the lifestyle) friendships broke off in the move.. So now I have no friends. Also, during covid, about a year ago,, I lost both my mom and dad. It was very hard on me.. He lost his brother 3 months ago in car accident- he lived with us when he died and I was the one who answered the door when the police came to tell us. It was very hard on both of us, but of course more so on him. I have no family left. I feel so alone. In this house with my boyfriend, who I dont feel close to anymore. Sometimes I feel like he ruined my life, because before we met I had a good life and was happy. I think he feels the same way sometimes too. I don't even know which of us is right anymore. All I know is, everything is dark. I have no connection anymore with anyone. Nothing is fun anymore. I cant afford therapy. I earn decent money, but the way the US health system works, it would still be hundreds of dollars a month even with insurance. Anyone have any actually helpful things to say? I feel trapped in a box with no way out. Even dying isn't the answer. I don't want to do that to my pets. I don't think my boyfriend would keep them if I died. I never feel like doing anything. I just feel empty. I have no connection to anything. Please help me feel like life is worth living again. That's probably a lot to ask.

I’m sad, I feel like I need a friend;I’ve been crying all day neglecting my collage work because I feel really lonely, I feel like I have no one to talk too. Yeah I have “friends” from high school but we never go out of our way to talk, and those conversations usually end quick. I have a boyfriend and He has friends that he goes to hang out with but I’m here at the end of the day by myself. Yeah it’s nice for him to ask me if he can hang out with his friends but it’s been everyday now and he only spend times with me when we eating something which last about 50 mins and then he ask if he could leave and go to his friends and play games. I don’t think it would be that much of a problem if I had friends, like yeah he likes to invite me to play with them but they aren’t my friends. It would be cool to have someone that I could talk to that cared about me and could distract me from myself. I’m just so sad. I need help, I don’t want to rely on my boyfriend being my only friend , especially when we argue and then not talk cause he can just have fun with his friends, while I on the other hand suffer and cries the whole day;I’m sad, I feel like I need a friend I’ve been crying all day neglecting my collage work because I feel really lonely, I feel like I have no one to talk too.

Is it normal to feel stressed while doing things that used to relax me?;"Just like everyone else, my life's been pretty stressful the last year. Ive usually dealt with stress and anxiety by doing relaxing things (to me) like looking at memes, reading, and playing the piano (I'm very bad at it, but I like to follow YouTube tutorials) Recently I've noticed that anytime I've tried to learn a new piece or do something more complex while playing, I've immediately become very anxious, my heart beat speeds up, and I get very uncomfortable. This is all very weird because I've never had these ""panic attack"" type things (I know it's not a real panic attack, and I'm not trying to diminish a real one, it's just the best ""euphemism"" I can come up with), and I've never had a problem learning more complex things on the piano. Is it normal to eventually feel stressed by something that used to do the opposite?

Can stress cause hallucinations and psychosis?;So, I’ve been incredibly stressed lately. To the point of not being able to move and having near constant panic attacks. I lost my job because I wasn’t able to keep up with tasks due to anxiety and stress. I’m on multiple medications none of which seem to help. I’ve been seeing shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye. Dark shadows of people standing over me staring intently. Animals scurrying across the floor or road. Sometimes just moving dots and lights. Recently I’ve been having very vivid dreams which alternate between watching myself commit suicide, or watching myself commit the murder of my significant other. I have random thoughts of how I can kill myself, or of destroying something, or if someone died how I’d dispose of the body.

Lacking the will to keep going, it's been like this for too long;I've tried everything in the past – medication, psychotherapy, etc., but I just can't improve my life. I was first diagnosed in 2005 and there have certainly been good and bad times since then, but one thing I've never been able to overcome is that I'm lazy. I simply lack the willpower to even do basic things. I am approaching my 30th birthday and I'm nowhere near where I want to be in life and with no realistic prospects of being there any time soon. I don't own a home, I'm so far off being ready to marry my girlfriend, no kids, struggling to get my career off the bottom rung of the ladder. I've been plagued by thoughts of ending it all for quite a while now and, to be honest, the only thing keeping me here is that I can't inflict that pain on people who care about me. But existing for the sake of preventing others' pain is so far from a satisfying or meaningful existence. I have no idea how to turn this around and the passage of time will only make this worse as I continue this unsatisfying existence. I'm not on the brink yet, but the longer this goes on, the closer I feel I'll get and I feel so helpless as I watch myself deteriorate.;Lacking the will to keep going, it's been like this for too long I've tried everything in the past – medication, psychotherapy, etc., but I just can't improve my life.

19year old In need of help and guidancr;Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool. I will get straight to the point College is too expensive. parents can't afford it, even if they can I wouldn't want to burden them. I will want to pay for my own college. But the problem right now is that my parents are retired. I'm really worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I can't help them because my parents don't allow me to get a job because of the covid. I know I'm an adult but I don't have a driving license or a car yet. So instead I'm just learning to code day till night every single day. I need at least 6month to be job ready. I hope that I can get a front end job by then. I have many things to learn ( web design, color theory, SEO, coding etc). I have only just started learning to code 1month ago. I feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier. Negative thoughts have been haunting me recently, Is like I develop another personality. This personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone / myself, thinking of parents passing away etc. This kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing. Also there is a side of me that feel like I'm missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college. This kind of negative thinking didn't appear at all when I was in school but because I heard from parents that they don't have enough money. Is been bothering me ever since I won't blame my parent and I know where I am now, I will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day, Im not taking any day off. Im very worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to learn the things needed. I'm really scared that my parent 60+yo will passed away early. All of this is stressing me out really badly I want to help them but I don't know how I can help. I don't have allowance. Worse is that I don't have any skill or talent. I feel like I don't have enough time to learn the things I need to learn because there so many. Sometimes it doesn't even get absorbs by my head because I'm rushing it. Also recently I've been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding.

my boyfriend is severely depressed, and sent me the following texts.;please tell me, what should i do? it breaks my heart to see him like this. (he talks about our relationship and his life situation in general. pd he recently started going to therapy) The texts “There are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail. I have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse. We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd. It would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else.” “It is simply useless already, it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever. There’s no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.” “I consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.” “Everything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.” “In December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.” It is very heartbreaking to see him like this. He has said these things to me many times, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way, but it is still hard. He always ends up coming back to me, and I want to be supportive of him and do whatever I have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me. 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible, but he keeps pushing me away. what should I really do?;my boyfriend is severely depressed, and sent me the following texts. please tell me, what should i do? it breaks my heart to see him like this.

Serious work anxiety;I've been having serious anxiety issues at work. I've been at my job for a long time. Moved to a different area of the same job. I am under constant pressure. Feel like I don't know what I'm doing even though I should at this point. I'm always afraid my managers think I'm an idiot. I work really hard but things are constantly blowing up in my face. Sometimes my fault sometimes not. No new training going to happen. I have to learn as I go. The real problem is im taking the stress home with me. Can't sleep. Can't focus on family things. Mind always racing. I dont want to leave my job. But I don't want to feel like this all the time. I want to not care as much.;Serious work anxiety I've been having serious anxiety issues at work.

Battling depression on and off.;"I have been struggling with depression on and off for the past 4-5 years, can't really say how long, but it has gotten even worse for the past year. A little back story, in the country I love in mental health is not really consider an issue, people just say ""put your head up and it will off be fine"" , or "" just man up there's nothing wrong with you"", ""stop talking bullshit and start working"", no one really exempts the fackt that depression is a real issue. I am a 30 year old male, I have a somewhat good job with good pay, company car that is all payed for and included gas for personal use aswell, but the issue is I don't really get days off, I am always working. I just might be burned out by now, but the reality of it is, that even if I am not at work I am constantly thinking of work, what I did wrong what could have been done better why didn't I do it like this or that, it makes my life miserable, I have turned to alcohol, and not really sleeping all too well aswell, I can't really stop myself from drinking, and that is just not good for me.

I’m teetering on the edge but I don’t want to give up;I’m so tired. Everything is a struggle and any scrap of happiness feels so foreign to me. I feel like I don’t deserve happiness or friendship and if I do have a moment of joy, I’ll feel guilty or undeserving shortly after. I’ll even feel like I deserve bad things to happen to me be that deserving an anxiety attack or physical pain. My anxiety isn’t getting any better either. I constantly have a feeling of impending doom, I’m constantly aware of my being and life will often feel like I’m watching a movie, just a series of events I’m not actually experiencing. I’m a trans guy and I want to transition but that desire is slowly dissolving. I feel like I should just stop trying because I have no hope left that the future will be better. I don’t feel real and I don’t feel like I’m ‘trans enough’ and I feel pathetic. I feel judged by *everyone* and I cannot ‘be myself’ because I don’t know who that person is. But I really don’t want to give up. Despite having no hope left, there are still things I want to see. I may not have any goals, but what I do have are small wishes. Small wishes like the wish to walk through a beautiful park on a sunny day with no worries, the wish to sit on a roof and look at stars or to eat at an all night diner with friends and just laugh. I think about these things a lot. I want to live long enough to actually *be there* I never thought I’d be at this point. I’ve told people that they didn’t have to worry because I’d never get low enough to think about suicide now that feels like so long ago.

my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore;being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat. i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you ) (please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had

No matter the location, most cultures have recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on Earth because without it, life here could not exist.;As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields. On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. Consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more. Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more. Here's a 3 minute [YouTube video]( expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings.;No matter the location, most cultures have recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on Earth because without it, life here could not exist. As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.

I feel like an empty shell;"That’s pretty much it, honestly. I’m a person who gets bored so, so easily; of books, games, shows, physical hobbies, and even, or especially, people. Nearly everything I’ve had a consistent obsessive interest in has to do with psychology or neuroscience, all so I could find out *something* about myself. The Thing. Answers. Relief. But really, I’m just… normal, boring, with extremely unrealistic expectations. It’s like I’m a broken bucket, no matter what and how much I add to my life, I’d be left with nothing. Within hours. A few days if I’m lucky. Sure, I feel lonely, but I have damn good friends, we’re close, we connect so well. I have a great support system. Yet, I’m more likely to avoid all that. Because it’s not stimulating enough, or perhaps not stimulating in the right ways, nothing personal. What are the right ways? Absolutely no idea. At the end of that day, I find myself back to the void, whether I’m pulled back into it forcefully or… idk, I sought it out myself out of fear, seeking familiar comfort, doesn’t really matter. Oh I know, this will pass, something will spark my interest eventually, but I will come back to the emptiness after. It’s a cycle, clearly, and I’m simply so very tired of reliving it and being stuck.";"I feel like an empty shell That’s pretty much it, honestly.

I’m freakin out man;Hey Reddit, I just searched for this sub so that I could vent a little. I’m pretty stressed right now about my finances and I’d just like to type mindlessly for a few minutes. I have a very steady and regular income with no fear of losing my job any time soon. I love what I do, and it pays... better than anything I’ve ever done before it. Due to the nature of things, I have to schedule vacations a year out, and being relatively young and naive, I decided it would be a good idea to schedule time off in July for my birthday and to visit my family in Kansas City area, and then again August to see my family in Alaska. Each trip was a week long. Some of you may already see the error of my ways. I was semi-prepared for the vacation in July, but it wasn’t until after the trip that I realized the flight for my wife and I to Alaska was going to be about double what I was expecting. Needless to say, I was financially unprepared for the trip but already committed, tickets in hand. The trip itself was a dream, and I loved every minute of it. Near the end of my trip, I realized just how unprepared I was, when I woke up and had $45 in my bank account. I still needed to drive home after my flight(in order to save about $300, I drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me. Cost of gas was about $70 round trip, for a total savings of about $225... it was worth it to me). Due to this and the fact I still had some bills to pay, I headed over to /r/Borrow and took out a loan(which I have since paid back). That covered me until I got paid.... until yesterday when I realized I was yet again behind, causing me to take another loan out(less than before so I guess I am technically ahead?). I sent out a check for my mortgage and it bounced, I’m a month behind on bills, and I’m practically living at biolife(plasma donation) right now trying to make ends meet. I transferred $35 into my bank account from my biolife cards so my mortgage check would go through. I’m at my wits end and don’t see a solution in sight. I’m stressed beyond belief. Please don’t comment on here telling me I’m a shithead for not managing my finances well... I know that and next month after I get paid, I’m doing absolutely nothing extra. Shit I might live on ramen this month if I have to. I need help dealing with this stress and really could use some help.

I wish I didn't wake up today.;So, this is my first time posting here. Or being here, in fact. But I don't know where else to go. It's only 9 12 AM where I live as I'm writing this. I'm in the middle of online class. I woke up at 2 AM and couldn't sleep again, so I decided to go to YouTube to kill time. Between 5 and 6 AM, I've listened to a few songs that only made me feel really sad and brought back bad memories, including one that I've frequently thought that I should listen to in case I try to kill myself in a way that wasn't instant. At this point, my suicidal thoughts only got worse and worse, to the point I actually pointed a knife to my neck, honestly thinking whether I should push in or pull away, but I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything. I've decided to check a few old texts and saw that my girlfriend sent me a text. I don't think it's in my right to share what it said in public, but... While she didn't say it explicitly, it's heavily implied that she cheated on me. And I can't help but think about how much this hurts. So I asked what the fuck she meant by that, and all I can do now is wait for an answer and hope that I'm just a bad person to even think that she did that, and that she didn't do what I think she did. And now, I'm here, in the middle of class, thinking what the fuck is the point of all of this, just wishing I didn't wake up at all today just so I wouldn't feel all this pain. I just want to stop hurting, even for a moment, but nothing is helping.;I wish I didn't wake up today. So, this is my first time posting here. Or being here, in fact.

I feel like I’m screaming for help and no one is listening;I’ve been trying to get better. Really trying. I’ve met with doctors to adjust my meds. I’ve missed 3 weeks of work getting all that shit sorted out, and trying to prioritize my mental health. Only to miss 3 weeks of pay and stress myself out more. As if 3 weeks could fix the 10 years of depression. I feel like everyone underplays how I’m feeling when I try to talk about it. I can’t decide if I want to just disappear, or end it. My family only cares about me getting back to work. It’s always been about just getting back to work. A job that I don’t even get a lunch break during, and no other breaks throughout the day. I’m a teacher. For 6th graders. Do I like my job? Yeah. Is it worth sacrificing even 10 minutes to get a deep breath and thought process in? Not so sure. Yet everyone this whole time has just asked “when do you go back to work?” Not how am I doing, how am I feeling, just when do I start making money again and being a productive member of society. Or “do it for the kids” and sometimes I just want to scream that maybe I need to make a decision FOR ME. I think the kids will be more traumatized if they learn their teacher off-ed herself because she realized it’s all fucking pointless. No one understands unless they’re going through it. Yet everyone wants to tell you what to do. They won’t say it but I know my parents and my boyfriend just think I’m weak and dramatic. My best friend at this point is my damn dog (who is the BEST boy and I really think the only reason I’ve held on this long). I’m at the point where I know I really want it all to end. But I wish a lightening bolt would just come down and do it for me so at least I won’t have died in a way that proves I am in fact just a weak loser. It sucks because I know I have passions and ambitions but they don’t align with the way everyone else wants me to live my life. And the cherry on top my fucking roommate is the most negative person I’ve ever met and leaves notes around the house about how much everything sucks! I’m negative too and agree everything sucks but goddammit I’m trying here and that’s not helpful. Even if it is sitting next to a fall scented candle.

Can someone read this ? It’s my full story;If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life. I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then. Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade My existential crisis began. 11th grade suicide attempts. 12 burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me — Thank you for reading. I’m grateful to whoever took the time out to read this. Sorry it was long. Edit- I really want to thank all of you for the kind words. Really I do. I wish I can meet all of you and you guys hugs because I was feeling lonely and felt the need to share I full story, but I didn’t expect this much feedback. I’m really grateful for all for this community and all you who react out red_heart .;Can someone read this ? It’s my full story If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life. I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then. Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life.

I really don't want to die. I actually really like life. I just don't like my life.;I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. I think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom I consider to be the majority). To me, life is wonderful. Except I don't like *my* life. I wish I could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what I'm looking for in life. I'm 21 and all I can think about is everything I have missed out on and will miss out on in life. I wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. I don't want to stop playing, I just wish I could start a new game.;I really don't want to die. I actually really like life. I just don't like my life. I think the world is beautiful.

It was always going to end like this;I know that I'm in an unhealthy cycle. I never break the cycle, no matter how well it's going. I'm supposed to be taking anti-depressants but I moved recently and I'm not going to send them to the pharmacy in my new town. I can't be in for my first therapy session until October and it wouldn't be worth it anyways because there is no world in which I can be honest with a therapist. This is why I know that my life was always going to end with me taking my life. I don't try to get better so I won't, even if I want to somewhere inside of me.

Makes friends get close, really get to know them alienate them slowly with your issues get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime repeat;This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago. I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again? It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

Does anyone else often feel like they've lost a loved one?;In the evening, I mostly imagine past lovers of my life and try to imagine some scenario within which I can somehow return to them, which is not possible. At night, I don't want to go to sleep because I know I'll be waking up feeling alone, neglected and like a loser. In the morning, I feel this empty sense of regret at the prospect of going another day without a true purpose or value. Sometimes I feel like my problem is that I am spoiled and have enjoyed life to much in comparison to what it has morphed into, and then I remember that I felt lonely and depressed as a young child. Maybe I missed my father, since my parents split up when I was very young.

Young US citizen extremely suicidal;I just had the worst day. Nothing that bad happened it just felt horrible. My meds dont do anything, therapy hasn't been working. I'm young in my early 20s from a difficult background. I'm so worried about barely paying rent and bills this month. Existence just feels like suffering. I'm really not an angry person but suddenly I feel such deep ANGER. Anger at the world and society and everything that has ever let me down and landed me in this situation. I hate my life. I tried so hard and still I'm here. Nothing I've done had been good enough to make me happy. I just want to die and I'm so sad. I don't want a stupid family and I don't believe my dreams are possible in this broken world. I never cared much for the soulless office life either. Adults failed me so much as I was growing up. I hate where I am and who I am and i really feel like most people only care about themselves. No one really cares for me. The people around me don't love me. The world is cold. I don't think there is a possible future where i could be happy. I don't even believe people's love for me is real anymore. I used to have friends i don't really anymore.

17 yo don't have a fucking clue about life;Hey, I've been so stressful with the things going on in my life ( finishing highschool, college exam, pandemic process etc. ) Actually it's mostly about my exam because in my country it's hard to find a valuable job without college our economy is going worse day by day so I think I must do it. And in Turkey it's also so stressful in these times for people because all the thing is depended on a single exam we do end of the year ( literally a single one day test we take ). Whether thinking about it or life I find myself always being sad because of a certain thing and I can't remember all of them in one tho. I feel like I'm not growing or I didn't grew at all I'm shorter than my coevals. My penis size is embarrassingly small. And in this young age I have a visually perceivable hair loss. I don't know. Tonight I'm sad with my hairs and that's why I decided to write. And I don't know what you people can help with but. I just feel sad and shitty. Maybe hair can be cured but I don't know anything about it tho. They started falling when I grew em longer than usually I use, and when I cutted them again they just didn't stop to. Now when I look into mirror and see baldy parts I hate my life. And I know this stress just makes everything worse but I want to have a normal penis, a not falling hair ( at least at my fucking 17th year ) and a nice college life but it seems I'm far far away from all of these. Also I'm fat and I want to exercise and shit but first I need to get start from somewhere with studying and then I think I can make all of these with an order. In the end it still seems like I can't do anything with the other 2 things. I don't know if it's the right place to write this down but I think I'm depressed since my 7th grade because just how life basically works.

Tonight I'm sad with my hairs and that's why I decided to write. And I don't know what you people can help with but. I just feel sad and shitty. Maybe hair can be cured but I don't know anything about it tho. They started falling when I grew em longer than usually I use, and when I cutted them again they just didn't stop to. Now when I look into mirror and see baldy parts I hate my life. And I know this stress just makes everything worse but I want to have a normal penis, a not falling hair ( at least at my fucking 17th year ) and a nice college life but it seems I'm far far away from all of these. Also I'm fat and I want to exercise and shit but first I need to get start from somewhere with studying and then I think I can make all of these with an order. In the end it still seems like I can't do anything with the other 2 things. I don't know if it's the right place to write this down but I think I'm depressed since my 7th grade because just how life basically works. Thank you for reading have a nice day.;1;

Exercise or activities that physically tire you might reduce your stress;Increasing the intensity of my exercise helped reduce my stress. I hope this suggestion will help you too. I have been crazy stressed since 2012. It got so bad last year that I couldn't stop over thinking and would get really upset about things. I tried talking to someone, journaling, mild exercise, colouring books, meditation, chanting, etc... everything helped a little but for the most part the stress was still affecting my sleep, motivation and outlook on things. Recently I was out and about with friends, walking in the sun and taking in nature. I was so exhausted by the end of it, that my stress and constant thinking stopped. The next morning I was still quite calm. So I decided to start walking 4km per a day to maintain that level of calm. It's been a week and so far so good. I fall asleep within minutes of getting into bed and I am still calm the next morning. I had to deal with a stressful situation today but I was so calm, I was able to add humour and make everyone else feel relaxed as well.;Exercise or activities that physically tire you might reduce your stress Increasing the intensity of my exercise helped reduce my stress.

Uncontrollable phrases?;"Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"". Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough? Edit thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better.

Self-sabotage;I like to think I’m good at managing whenever depression hits but lately reality proved otherwise. I’m at the final stages of writing my masters thesis which is due by the end of September and while I had pretty good head start with only the intro left to write and results and discussion mostly done, I know realize I spent the last three weeks avoiding it with all my might. Whenever I think about writing my heart starts racing and I just shut down, lay on my bed and don’t even turn my computer on. I told my supervisor that by now I’d have it mostly finished and now I feel like a total failure who is only able of disappointing people. I feel myself spiralling and don’t know how to stop.;Self-sabotage I like to think I’m good at managing whenever depression hits but lately reality proved otherwise.

I dont want to live anymore, medical hell rant.;"I've been feeling really stressed and depressed with everything going on in my life lately. I graduated college a few years ago and I cant find a job in my field. they dont want to take their chances with someone who has little experience. All of them usually try to require AAA game experience or 3+ years experience. I went for game development with an art emphasis. I've been trying to get out of my current manufacturing job since It has been causing me alot of stress. Not only that but I have so many health problems going on. I got my tubes tied last year hoping it would help with depression. Since I wouldnt be on meds anymore. But after surgery I was throwing up and shaking for almost 10 hours. It was a vary painful recovery, and it still hurts sometimes. Then a few months later I had a bad flare of vasculitis. We dont know what caused it. Could.it be my juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, my surgery, the clips they put in during surgery, stress, or my medication. We dont know. Not only dont we not know but I feel like my doctors have given up. I got a response from a nurse saying that these things just happen sometimes.... my legs have scarring from the vasculitis, and they keep coming and going. 2 different arthritis meds and other meds to attempt to suppress it... I feel like it's not working or helping. I want to give up and cancel all my appointments and stop taking my meds Then because of my depression over the years I havnt been taking care of myself.. I have had 6 fillings so far this year. 2 are still painful. And the dentist keeps trying to ""fix it"" but I feel like he his causing more problems. Not only that but they refuse to do anything about holes on one of my back molars. Then I looked at braces bit I nerd to fix 3 more fillings, then have oral surgery, then have braces put on. Do I even try with how bad my teeth are? Is it worth it when they are all going to fall out anyways.. I feel like I'm not getting anywhere anymore, I just turned 24 this last Thursday...

Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.;Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn’t the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it’s been years and I’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I’m proven wrong. Edit it’s been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments. Those of you who commented or will comment I see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together.;Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.

Being traumatised by a depression..(?);Hi guys, First time posting here, but read over the years here and there some posts.. Well as in the title here my situation 3 years ago I started analytic therapy, had a girlfriend that time and some heavy anxiety made things very difficult. (My father died when I was 14, which made it later then hard to love someone without fear) Well it went really good actually till 2020 The relationship was a lil toxic for me, it had a very polarising dynamic.. it made me depressive - September 2020 came along and one day to another it hit me with panic, cry attacks, mental breakdowns I started taking medication, Elontril (US is wellbutrin or something).. it’s simply a Bupropion Derivate.. nevermind It was heavy and after a long path of heavy pain I never experienced in my life before the relationship ended. Now since March a long and slow positive trend happened I basically have no social anxiety what so ever. Talking to many people and going out actually helps me. I also have barely heavy self doubts. I like myself and I think I don’t deserve this depression at all. My main thing is Hopelessness.. that it is or will be chronic. That it never ends and I will end up having it forever I have a strong family and friends holding my back and all those actually positive things should make my depression way better or push me out of that.. But it doesn’t which worries me even more. Now I experience a small downwards spiral again..(well I am studying physics and it’s stressful recently- so there might be the reason) Now to my big worries (which may be part of depressive thoughts person_shrugging face_with_raised_eyebrow ) The biggest cause of all my shit at the moment is a clearly noticeable wrong affection. I see something or feel something or smell something and a depressive feeling comes up.. no “I hate my self” or “I don’t deserve etc”. No thinking problem. Rather a feeling problem. It is simply just that my own reality seems heavily distorted and I am so good damn fucking afraid of another hell like late 2020.. it makes me panic to think about that happening again.. This depression traumatised more than anything in my distant past.. my depression gave me such a trauma, that it seems to stay. It induced it self.. And I have such a fear, that there is now solution to this at all.. I don’t see me as a person how is always struggling with depression It can’t be. I do except that I am in that position now and a part of me also thinks that every single soul on this planet can overcome an endogene Depression (non psychiatric) for good. Everyone must find there own way but I feel how this mental state fades recently and it gives me instant panic because depression-trauma. Has anyone also such a concrete feeling of being traumatised by the depression itself? Is there a way to deal with that. To break that circle? (I have to add that I WAS a hypochondriac but psychoanalysis made it almost go away but I think it is focused now on the depression yall fee me?

At my lowest;It’s my mother’s birthday and my father planned her this surprise party and everything is going great, everything’s perfect.

Everyone is currently singing and there’s this Mariachi’s band playing and I just can’t help but cry. I can’t socialize anymore, I said hello to family but I just don’t feel comfortable being here anymore. I wish I was, I wish I could be happy and cheering them on but instead, I’m crying writing a post of Reddit because I don’t know what else to do other than be on my phone and ignore the fact that I’m not someone people or family talk to during these events.

How do I deal with school with depression?;So I'm going into the 10th grade this year (which for some of you is year 11), but I'm very worried about how I'll be able to keep on top of school. Last school year I barely did anything at all -- I couldn't. The beginning of my academic downfall was when I was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems. During and when I got out I felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything, especially school work. I would never shower, never brush me teeth, never flush the toilet, never clean my bedroom, (you know the routine). My school is very demanding, but I was lucky that the faculty was aware that I wasn't able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and I physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort. Now that summer is over and school is starting again, I have no idea how I'm going to manage keeping on top of my work. I do really want to try my best this year but I can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed. This year I won't get the same leniency as I did last year, and honestly I can't say I want it either because it too came with its downsides. Other kids would get angry at me because I was exempt from doing some assignments, and also it made me feel as if I'd failed at being a human along with everything else. I could barely keep on top of my hygiene, I wouldn't eat, I could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house. It was as if I was a baby that had to be carried around due to it's helplessness, I hated it. albeit It was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education.

Can't keep doing this (venting);I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young. I knew there was something wrong with my brain, but whenever I tried to ask my parents for help or to see someone about it, they would brush it off. Now though, years and years later, I do see a psychiatrist and I'm in therapy, but I hit an excruciating swing of depression for the past few weeks. I can't stop thinking about how much I've screwed up my life, how many people I've disappointed, how the things I've done and been through are impossible to come back from. I've lost weight at an extreme speed because I can't gather the motivation to go make myself something to feed myself, or really the motivation to do anything. I think about death a lot. How it could just end this whole cycle. Every minute just drags on and it's messing with my perception of time. And I'm just so TIRED of sleeping, not wanting to do anything but sleep, but then feeling like a failure for not getting anything done. I have a couple friends who check up on me, but I feel like I don't deserve them. I don't wanna bring their mood down, it doesn't feel like I'm being a good friend back. And I just really can't keep doing this, can't keep waking up feeling exactly the same or worse from the day before. I don't know how much longer I can take it.;Can't keep doing this (venting) I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young.

Overwhelmed by College;I have a Computer Science class for 6 hours once a week on Saturdays. I feel like everyone is understanding everything and I feel like I'm the dumbest guy in the class. I had one of the lowest scores on my test, a 48/100. I can't get my program assignment to work, while every one else has theirs working like it was no problem, and whenever I ask for help, I feel like the professor is upset at me because it was something we learned about earlier in the semester. I do pay attention in class, but I have to get up at 5 00 AM to be able to make it to class at 7 00 AM for my PreCal class, and I have English 1A. And I'm always scheduled to work from 6 30 PM - 10 30 PM at my job, giving me almost no time to sleep.

Have any of you seen the aftermath of suicide?;I feel really suicidal right now, with school starting tomorrow and all. I have nothing to live for as I have lost all my friends and any sort of emotion. Every time I think about killing myself, I go on gore subreddits and look at photos of suicide aftermath and it scares me into survival. Not like I have access to a gun anyway, but it sort of grounds me into the realty of the situation. I think about my poor mother finding my head exploded like a pumpkin. That would destroy her. Still thinking about doing it somehow, but the fear keeps me from doing it for a short period of time. Enough time to hopefully distract myself with anything I can find.;Have any of you seen the aftermath of suicide? I feel really suicidal right now, with school starting tomorrow and all.

Not like I have access to a gun anyway, but it sort of grounds me into the realty of the situation. I think about my poor mother finding my head exploded like a pumpkin. That would destroy her. Still thinking about doing it somehow, but the fear keeps me from doing it for a short period of time. Enough time to hopefully distract myself with anything I can find.;1;

Hi;Hello, I have recently (2 years ago) had a panic attack during a certain recreational activity and i have never been able to recover from it. I am 22 years old studying/living abroad and i am very new to stress, im not even sure it is stress. If i could describe my symptoms then someone would confirm for me... that would be great. It usually starts with thoughts contemplating life and then spirals out of control, even typing it on to this subreddit makes me shudder. Thoughts of imminent doom and uncertainty. I would then go into panic attack mode and wait for the nightmare to be over. Is this stress or psychosis? i sometimes feel im going made. recently i started having night terrors, extremely vivd ones which i can still remember several months after, I've had 3 bad ones so far and sometimes im afraid to go to sleep because of them. I don't wan't to take any medication, i know my family has a history of depression and ive heard about the zombi-fying effect some drugs have. My usual stress reliever has been going to the gym but recently ive been having panic attacks there too. Typing this post has eased my mind somewhat and any comments would probably do the same Regards, Jon;Hi Hello, I have recently (2 years ago) had a panic attack during a certain recreational activity and i have never been able to recover from it.

I’m killing myself [update];So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons. I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”;I’m killing myself [update] So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life.

How do I come back from a joke gone poorly?;"I’m too lazy to make an alt acc or whatever. Last night I went to dinner with some of my coworkers who I was becoming pretty good friends with. I’ll say this now, I was a little under the influence. Over the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with financial struggles, the passing of my grandpa, who was my last grandparent alive, and not being able to leave my house and go hang with other people. Back to last night, things were going okay and we were all having fun, I think. My one pal and I always crack, I guess you could say, “edgy” jokes. He was like “Oh yeah btw guys, (me) is a violently racist person.” It took me a good 30-45 seconds to realize what he said and all my friends were like “(me) what the fuck dude, are not gonna say anything?” I tried to explain that I infact wasn’t and that it was a joke, but it was too late. About 5 min later we were still cracking jokes and we were talking about our newest coworker (she wasn’t with us). My edgy friend asked what ethnicity she was and I said she was African American, because I genuinely thought she was, even though I’ve only interacted with her like 3 times. My very liberal manager got up and said “dude are you fucking retarded?” She had never said something like this to me before so I was caught off guard. My mind was scrambling and I was thinking, “Ok, what is she then? She has to be one of the other ones [ethnicities]” Well my stupid monkey brain said “Oh one of the other ones” out loud and everyone just looked at me. At this moment I knew I was fucked and there was no way of helping myself. Over the next couple hours most of them didn’t really talk to me at all and I could tell that they were genuinely disappointed in me and I felt all of this guilt engulf me. I sent a long message in our group text and only one of them responded saying “yeah man, the stuff you said rubbed us the wrong way and we are not the audience for that.” After that they have yet to talk to me and I have to go work later and I can’t get myself to cheer up at all. Do you guys have any advice. TL;DR I made a ignorant and slightly racist comment while under the influence at dinner with my coworkers and they are very angry at me and aren’t responding to my apologies.";"How do I come back from a joke gone poorly?

Over the years have developed a Pavlov-esque stress reaction to just multitasking at my computer, typing, sending emails, etc...;Very busy and stressful job leads to head pressure, anxiety, severe tension, then detachment...not good. And I’m just working from home! Can’t figure out how to fix this. The multitasking triggers the head pressure and then spirals from there. It lasts even through the weekend and has long term effects. Meditation helps but only very temporarily. After a long vacation it’s better for a while then slip right back into it. Strange... it’s such a tense high blood pressure-like feeling as if what I’m working on has life or death consequences...when it’s just regular financial work. Tell myself to not care as much but I don’t even think it’s that... the work/laptop take me to that stressful place no matter what I’m working on.;Over the years have developed a Pavlov-esque stress reaction to just multitasking at my computer, typing, sending emails, etc...

No hope for me. Fail in everything I do, even death.;I can’t do anything right, not even kill myself. I have nothing left to lose. I so desperately want to kill myself, but I have no real means of doing so efficiently. Lexapro apparently won’t kill me. I’m tired of remembering my ex girlfriend. I’ve dreamt about her so much and all steps I’ve taken to move on just seem fucking pointless because I’m so haunted by the experience. My asshole father was never around. Didn’t bother calling or wishing me well a few years ago following another failed suicide attempt. Wasn’t there for me when I was little being molested by my uncle. One of the only people I ever looked up to at the time. Mom doesn’t care. Reiterated my own feelings toward the abuse as being my fault. Yelled and grew frustrated with me for constantly asking for years if she could take me to get tested for STDs. Told me the other day that my last attempt was so I could get my ex’s attention. I’m out of shape, ugly inside and out, and I have no redeeming qualities. No job. Have no money. No friends. Don’t ever want to love again because I don’t have feelings anymore.

I am not going to be alive at the end of the year;I can't be alive anymore. The other day I thought about breaking up with my girlfriend because I'm not happy and then I thought that I should wait until the end of the school year but I can't keep being in a relationship. I don't think that romantic relationships are for me. I'm supposed to be taking anti-depressants but I moved and I still haven't contacted the pharmacy to have them send it to me. It's been months. In July I tried to schedule therapy and the earliest opening they have is in late October. I don't like talking about how I really feel and my lack of willingness to be vulnerable makes all of these attempts to get better pointless.

Tired of boyfriend's anxiety.;I just don't get why he won't freaking go to the doctor, his GP or a Psychiatrist, and address his freaking anxiety! He has ADHD and is Asperger's/Autistic.

Paying bills, setting and organizing Appointments, freaking talking to people for his or our accounts because he's too anxious for it, picking up the chores he started but won't finish because his friends pop up on Discord and want to play so he doesn't want to keep them waiting or else they will leave. And if I don't help and his anxiety increases I have to deal with the freaking meltdowns! I'm just tired of it today, yo.

43 and completely lost;I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression. I'm so disappointed in the person I've become. No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges. I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations. I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking. I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave. I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years. My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder. I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy. Nothing seems to help. I'm unbelievably critical of myself. Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit. I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written. I'm even more amazed by the responses. How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice? I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained. I can't imagine giving advice to someone. There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress. I'm a mess right now. I have lost hope of getting better. I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day. I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents. Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me. The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since. I have some solid friends that I've known since high school. They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. I can't seem to learn anything these days. I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things. I can't imagine surviving another 40 years. I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer. I've no real skills to rely on. I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day. I no longer think I'm capable of having a family. Too overwhelming. I would be an awful spouse and father. I don't plan to go back to work. I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life. By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them. My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run. I've read so much on coping with this disease. But so little spurs me to action. Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions. The weed stopped working for me though. Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse. Thanks for reading all this. I love you.;43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.

I'm a lazy, pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life, in debt, no degree, lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything.;Title says it all. My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man. I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand. Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt. I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live. I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man. I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway. Edit to everyone young reading this, just try to promise me you'll at least go to school and get a degree, not to impress anyone like most egomaniacs, but just so you have a good job and can get your own place and be proud of yourself. You don't want to end up like be, I promise you that.;I'm a lazy, pitiful 35 year old man child that never amounted to anything in his life, in debt, no degree, lives with his mom and can never follow through on anything. Title says it all. My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man. I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand. Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt. I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live. I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man. I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

Thinking about getting a puppy dog_face ;I was fine for a long time. But recently my depression has come back and in full swing. Including suicidal ideation. I’m thinking about getting a puppy soon, personally a (healthy, correctly bred) toy chihuahua that I can dress up and take care of and take with everywhere and be my baby. Lol rolling_on_the_floor_laughing it sounds corny but the thought of having an animal that loves you unconditionally and NEEDS you seems like a good emotional support. I’ve had dogs in the past and they were such a great positive influence. Y’all have pets that you love? Helps get you through the day?

Need better coping mechanisms for stress;Whenever I am working on homework and it just isn't making sense or is to hard, I get really stressed and frustrated. I am a stress crier so when this happens I just start sobbing or I get really angry (I have a collection of bad pencils that I snap in half). It is really annoying because it basically incapacitates me for an hour and drains all motivation I had to continue working. This seems really unhealthy and I would love any advice for coping mechanisms I can use to stop this from happening. Thanks;Need better coping mechanisms for stress Whenever I am working on homework and it just isn't making sense or is to hard, I get really stressed and frustrated.

Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length;"Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff. My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way. As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly. My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive";"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone.

Is disassociation depression or something else?;"When my stress gets bumped up to 11/10, I tend to disassociate a lot. I'll read comics/books, listen to music, get lost in my own head, or maybe even dive into food or another (to me) addictive source of dopamine. Overall, just losing my touch with reality. It's like intentionally trying to put blinders on. I'm trying to stay in reality because, in this case, my stress is caused by my long distance fiance getting a job near me, and moving her and myself into an apartment. One element of this is that her family is very much a planning one. My family is very much of a ""get it done asap"" type deal. Whereas she wants a three week process, I'd rather just get it done. Sorry, sidetracked. My question is if disassociating while stressed is a symptom of my depression, or another issue I need to address? Either way, other than a generic ""practice mindfulness"", what is something I can do with a busy schedule to remain in touch with myself?";"Is disassociation depression or something else?

Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier!;I met this girl on Hinge - she and I instantly hit it off and had long conversations over text. After a few days I suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person, and she agreed. We met, ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother. The next date didn't go as well - she was in a different state and it was virtual. I wasn't in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing. I thought I had ruined it. She even picked up on it and suggested we don't date anymore, but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back. A few weeks later, conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together. Flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying, so at the end of the day I asked if she wanted to try again. She was hesitant and said she'd let me know. A few months later we're still dating, staying over at each others houses, having 10+ hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books, poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we can't be together or on the phone. This is the first time in a long time I've been this happy with someone else, and I really hope she becomes my forever partner <3;Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier!

Finally starting to see progress from working out!!!;I’ve been skinny fat ever since my sophomore year of high school when i stopped playing football (currently a junior in college) Ever since then i’ve been in this limbo of sort of fit but unhealthy, but junior year of high school i got very out of shape. In the past few months i’ve finally found the motivation to commit to a work out routine and eat healthy everyday and i’m finally seeing changes!!! Physically i’m looking more fit and mentally i feel great. A lot of minor issues i’ve been experiencing have vanished since I started working out, I still haven’t fixed my sleep schedule. Im currently in a long distance relationship and by the time we close the gap i’m hoping my partner won’t recognize me! I’m only just now seeing progress and i’m really excited for the future ) I hope you all are well <3;Finally starting to see progress from working out!!!

Hard to think. My job is completely stressful. When i'm there i'm constantly looking at my computer screen doing work. If not one thing then 3 different things at once. I don't take breaks outside of lunch. I feel like everyone at my office hates me. They think i'm ""boring"". No. I'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office. I don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so I literally have nothing to talk about. I""m judged negatively for this everyday. I beat me self up for this everyday. Its like i'm being jumped by a bunch of bullies and i'm the worst one. Support doesn't exist. I live with people I don't talk to at all. No love. I'm unattractive to everyone.

Stiffness in the neck. Hard to speak. Hard to think. My job is completely stressful. When i'm there i'm constantly looking at my computer screen doing work. If not one thing then 3 different things at once. I don't take breaks outside of lunch. I feel like everyone at my office hates me. They think i'm ""boring"". No. I'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office. I don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so I literally have nothing to talk about. I""m judged negatively for this everyday. I beat me self up for this everyday.

I almost killed myself tonight;"I know nobody will read this... I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty. The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy. I just want this to end so badly. Why can't she care about me? About my life? I just need a friend in her. Fuck my life so bad.";"I almost killed myself tonight I know nobody will read this...

Cooked For Myself For the First Time I Feel So Accomplished Right Now!!;25F So I have never been so enthusiastic to cook in the past and also didn't have anyone to truly show me my dad was always working so I have always been buying premade foods or making simple stuff like grilled cheese that was around the house. For a long time I have always wanted to try to cook, but I have always been so intimated by recipes and feeling like I can never cook that or this... So I decided the other day I wanted to start simple nothing crazy like a four course meal that would be served at a 5 star restaurant with a complicated recipe. So I decided I wanted to try and cook roasted root veggies it just sounded so good. Plus also a healthy snack/lunch to bring to work with me <3 It isn't perfect, but I am so proud of what I made all by myself <3 Ingredients used Gold Potatoes, zucchini, baby carrots, mushrooms Cut all into 1 inch sizes and mixed with extra virgin olive oil with a little bit of salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. I really wanted to share I don't have many people in my life to talk about this accomplishment I made today I am so happy I cant stop smiling I am so proud of myself and I proved to myself that **I CAN do this WHEN I MAKE IT SO!!** I know this isn't the most crazy and extravagant recipe and it may not mean anything to anyone besides myself, but I am so proud of myself that I did this today and I wont lie I am a little emotional because I never thought I could do something like this. I am just so proud of myself all together and want to keep going. Sorry if this is long but I wanted to share. It tastes so yummy and I cant wait to make this again and maybe try other versions <3 <3 [SO PROUD OF MYSELF!!](;Cooked For Myself For the First Time I Feel So Accomplished Right Now!! 25F So I have never been so enthusiastic to cook in the past and also didn't have anyone to truly show me my dad was always working so I have always been buying premade foods or making simple stuff like grilled cheese that was around the house.

Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same. Like logically I knew they must exist but it's still just unfathomable in my mind. It kinda makes me sad that I don't understand them just as much as they don't understand me.

I’m so tired.;I thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence, I’d be ok. That I’d be away from my family, and I wouldn’t feel so horrible all the time. That was a fucking lie, because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too. I can’t hold a conversation without overthinking, I embarrass myself and act weird, and this sounds stupid as fuck but I’m terrified of the boys in my class. They’re not dangerous or any of that, they’re just so loud I wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them. I can’t do it. The cycle, the heaviness, both physical and mental, my demanding studies. I guess my next plan is to get into a good university, and keep up my academics so I can get a job and move out. There’s this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships, but I don’t know if I should try because I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I failed to secure a good future for myself. I mean, I’m still freshman so I shouldn’t put to much emphasis into my future as of yet. I still have time. But I feel like I’ve been thrown in for a loop because I don’t even think I’ll make it past graduation age alive. I have to get up. My bag is so heavy with the textbooks. My body hurts from all the cuts, and bandages are such a nuisance. My parents are so overwhelming and scary. Im not even that smart of a person. I made the choice of joining this UN council type thing as an after school program. I thought it’d look good on college applications, but I’m a very shy and withdrawn person and I’ve realized I’m probably going to get my ass kicked in any debate. The other students in the council are so much more clear with their words, more accomplished and brilliant than I am. I don’t stand next to them at all. I thought this last year sucked ass. I don’t know what I’m going to do about this one. Thanks for listening to my rant, if you’ve read this far. I bid you a good day;I’m so tired.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?";"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. Here's the breakdown with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.";"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago.

We lost our baby;My fiancé and I just spent the better part of this week in the hospital after our son was born stillborn at 20 weeks. I had been doing so well before this. I take my medicines.

I’m not religious so I don’t care about any of that. I just truly don’t think I was meant to deal with the things the universe throws my way.

It burns to live.;Lost, confused, tired, no motivation, mentally drained, physically weak, no reason to live, nothing to look forward to, comfort in sadness, no place in society, family expectations, loneliness, future. I don’t want to be a part of this world. I don’t want to be helped. I just want to die. Why is it so hard to just die? Why couldn’t I have no one around me, so I could just easily die without devastating their lives? The only possible thing that would bring me relief is death, but I can’t do it because of my family. Instead, I’m forced to struggle to do what billions do without breaking a sweat, like taking care of their hygiene and being sociable. If this isn’t an infernal hell, then what is?

So grateful for my partners support and love.;I have always been obsessed with the idea of feeling “at home” and have struggled to truly find it. I was neglected as a child making it feel like there was no safe place for me to escape and relax to and I’ve been living on my own, moving from place to place for the past few years and nothing has felt “right”. It’s always felt so temporary and like I’m just waiting and hoping the next place fulfils that void. I am moving again, mid-month, so I’m crashing at my boyfriends place for two weeks and he has made it his mission to make his space feel like a home for me because he knows how much it means to me. He has been cleaning, organizing and prepping his room for my stay and im just so grateful for how much he’s doing for me. He even said that I could make a small garden in his backyard because he knows how much I’ve always wanted one of my own and since I’ve been apartment living, I’ve never been able to have one myself. I’ve never felt this loved before nor experienced someone making me feel so happy and grateful for their existence.;So grateful for my partners support and love.

Whining about my past and current state;"I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here) Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it upside-down_face However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight? Well you'll hate yourself either way, don't you? Gyms are open again? Well, fucking fall while biking, hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you can't even bike anymore, because you've got no money to repair it! And let's face it... You need money for a new PC first, because yours is broken and you need one for university, you need new clothes, at least a jacket for when it gets colder!"". I really can't do this anymore. Maybe I'm just whiny... I don't know. But in the end that's just a small insight into my life. I'm 22 now and I'm at that point again I wonder if it even makes sense anymore. Especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either. And the worst thing is... Compared to others, looking at what I've reached yet (at least looking at my apartment). I feel horrible, because I should probably feel good about myself, because I've got it better. I've invested a lot of money into it and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Others would dream of that at that age... Maybe I just can't get enough? I really don't know... Thanks for reading tho. Don't know if anyone got some advice or ideas what I can do. Hope this wasn't too much, but I really have to get this off my chest.";"Whining about my past and current state I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here) Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it upside-down_face However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight?

I’m at a point where I may have to take a leave of absence from work.;I’m scared right now. I didn’t think I’d get this low again, but here we are. The stress and pressure of work has been building up and I feel like everything is going to collapse. I had a talk with my boss and was told I could take the time if need be. I’m not ok. I’m scared to be off of work in any capacity. I don’t qualify for FMLA since I haven’t been in my position long enough. But I’m taking the necessary steps to get the help I need. I don’t know what will happen, but I know mentally, I’m in a very dark place.;I’m at a point where I may have to take a leave of absence from work. I’m scared right now.

People stressed me by tolding me to stop being stressed, How to deal with stress today?;"I was easily stressed and angry when I was a kid. Each time it happens my family give me little sentence like Calm yourself. Why are you stressing over X? I'm not stressed for X. why are you angry ? ? Am I angry ? no? so you shouldn't be angry You will have health issues if you continue to be stressed. you will have issue in your work if you are angry. ... They never try to resolve the reason why I was stressed or angry.(that's another issue) Only to ""fix"" the stress in a condescending way. And all their little phrases increased my stress and my anger exponentially. **Today, i'm a 35 adult women.** And fortunately, no one, including those who previously do, don't say this to me anymore . Some of them even admit to me they used those to increase my angry for fun at this time and that they are sorry for that. (I knew that. But it didn't help) The issue is, today, each time I'm stressed, or angry , I still hear those advice in my head. It's still stress me even more, angry-me even more, and can make me cry. That happen, no matter what was the original stress was about. I can cry because my bus is late, because it will trigger some memory like the time I was told I shouldn't be angry for missing a bus because it was my fault of missing the bus. But I can support the pression of talking in front of 400 persons for 1 hour because it won't trigger any old memory. It's also hard to explain to other why I am such a stress mess sometime, but able to support a lot other-time. Consequently some-people think I'm faking my stress.

Everything's to much;So, I have no idea where to start. First of all I want to apologize for possible grammatical mistakes or typos since english is not my mother tongue. University is stressing me out lately. I know bohoo university is stressful. My ADD doesn't make it easier though. I am far behind with any exercise and I am running out of days. I really try my best but for any reason anyone else is way faster in handling this amount of exercises. I feel like a dumb peace of shit because I can't even handle an art bachelor degree course. I have no energy lately. Everything's overwhelming me. I feel like I am constantly on the edge of breaking down in tears. My boyfriend is sick, that's why I have to do most of the housework. Because of his illness he'll go in rehab in a bit more than a week. Idk I am just, overwhelmed by life I guess. And I wish there was someone who could just take away half of the excersises I have to do. I want to stop the time for a month, for rehabilitation. And then for another so I can catch up with all these excersises. Thank you for reading so far, I really appreciate that. I hope I didn't bore you. Please be nice if you decide to comment.

Do you guys get quickly tired when talking to people?;I have very little energy for the day by default, but I found that talking with someone quickly drains me and depletes whatever energy i do have. After just a little while i feel like I can barely talk anymore, i feel literally like I'm losing air and then i basically have to force myself to speak. Oh well.;Do you guys get quickly tired when talking to people?

TW. Tried to kill myself Friday. Now I’m trapped;Friday was my breaking point. I didn’t want to be here anymore. I put a gun to my head and couldn’t pull the trigger. I tried so hard but I was afraid. So I took some Xanax to help relax me but still couldn’t do it. I ended up calling my boyfriend and he came to get everything. Right now only 2 people know and I’m really low. He took all of my weapons and my pills. I still think about an escape but I know I can’t do anything. I’m trying to do better but it’s hard. I still wake up wishing I did it.;TW. Tried to kill myself Friday. Now I’m trapped Friday was my breaking point. I didn’t want to be here anymore.

For the first time in my veterinary career, a client got me a gift to show gratitude;I've been a vet for four and a half years and I specialize in critical care. I run an overnight emergency clinic and mostly see patients who are so ill or injured that it can't wait until the regular clinics open. Naturally it's very high stakes work and we don't save every patient. We also aren't the type of clinic that has a lot of regular clients that we see regularly. People don't bring their cat here for booster shots. They go to regular clinics for that. Yesterday I walk in and find a box of chocolate with a note on it from a recent client thanking me for what I do. I remember her dog. Strongly hypocalcemic seizure patient who did not make it. But despite that the client found it prudent to thank me anyway and that actually made me tear up some. I shared the treats with my staff because it's not just me here and they also deserve it. I just wanted to share because it really did give me a boost. I actually really enjoy what I do and I've worked really hard to get here and it's good to know people actually appreciate it.;For the first time in my veterinary career, a client got me a gift to show gratitude I've been a vet for four and a half years and I specialize in critical care.

If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.;Posting this from my second account. This year has been the worst of my (26 F) life. My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful. Edit thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain.

My school is letting me register for fall!;So I went to a state school for my BA. The tuition isn’t that bad it’s like 6K a year. But I stayed in the student housing and THAT was $21,000 a year.

But last winter, even though I got A- in ALL my classes they wouldn’t let me register for classes for the spring Bc I owed 16,000 still for the housing. I was in good academic standing so they said I could come back, I just had to pay off the bill first. Fast forward a few months, I moved back home, got a job, and have been paying monthly increments of $1,000, im down to $12,000. A few weeks ago I just went ahead and asked if I could take summer classes, and they let me. (Yay me!) And then today for some reason they told me I’m going to be allowed fo register for classes for the fall. I’m back on track to get my BA in two years rather than three!

I was hungry and just found a Baby Ruth in my freezer that i accidentally hid from my self.;A few weeks ago there was a nasty heat wave in Washington State. The wife and I just went shopping and not ready to eat this beloved object put in the freezer so it would not melt. Apparently the wife had put some frozen veggies on top of it and it was long forgotten. Looking through the freezer tonight I have found this long forgotten treasure and it's currently defrosting before me. I haven't felt happiness like this too much this year and my wife is laughing at me for squealing like a schoolgirl.;I was hungry and just found a Baby Ruth in my freezer that i accidentally hid from my self.

Why is the world like this?;My brother is going to the marines soon and I’m excited for him. Ever since he started talking about joining the marines, I also wanted to do that in the near future. When I decided to talk to my mom about joining the marines, she says no. At first I thought it was absurd but her reason was that most females within these military programs get raped, sexually assaulted and/or harassed. Now it just stress me out even more for me to not be able to try something without the fear of being attacked because I’m a certain gender. Man, why is the world like this. (This is a rant, sorry if it doesn’t make sense, I just had to get this off my chest);Why is the world like this? My brother is going to the marines soon and I’m excited for him.

"They say, ""Money doesn't buy happiness,"" but it's extremely hard to stay happy when you're broke.";Just for context my job closed down thanks to Covid. I've got a kid, bills, food I need to buy, medicines I need to pick up. Every day, it feels like there's something new going on. I haven't even bought a single Christmas present for my child because I can't afford it, and soon, if I don't find a way to get help, I won't be able to afford essentials, either. I feel like I am drowning, my throat closing constantly from stress, depression, and anxiety. The only reason I wake up anymore is for my kid. I just want things to be normal again.

Any good jobs for people with suicidal depression and chronic anxiety?;For context, I live in the UK in a rural area, 18 and no qualifications whatsoever.

I realise I'm lucky to have a job at all, especially given how I have zero achievements. But I can't deal with the pressure. I've looked online for good jobs for people with mental problems but it's all focused around city folk. Have any of you guys had any luck or no?

Recent events have killed what little motivation I had. Now I'm just sick due to stress.;15 years ago, my life was miserable. My depression and anxiety were out of control. I was diagnosed with a potentially deadly rare genetic disorder, as well as IBD and Fibromyalgia. I lost so much weight I would cry when I saw myself in a mirror, my mother would cry when she saw me too. And my marriage was falling apart. My wife left my to fend for myself and I lived alone for a year. In that year I built myself back up, got my health issue's (mental and physical) under control, and blossomed. But I was still just existing, not truly living. So I did the most spontaneous thing I've ever done, and moved across country, leaving everyone and everything behind. Moving across country was the best decision I've ever made. I was healthier than I'd been in years, I was enjoying my life, doing things I'd never thought I'd do. In short, I was happy and living my best life. But good things don't last forever. A few years later I moved back because of family issues and some emotional manipulation on their part. I came home to chaos and was instantly thrown back into the hell I had left. But they, my family, got what they wanted so they didn't really care what it cost me emotionally and physically. But, I still had hope I could do or be something more, I still had dreams. But that was 6 years ago. Slowly my dreams dwindled away and my hope was dying, but I still tried to hang on to that, until today. For the last month I've been strapped for money because of some ridiculousness. I've been fighting for weeks to get it back, and finally I got it back today. But there was a problem, because why wouldn't there be. After all that fighting to get my money back, my bank has decided to hold it for 3 to 7 business days. The timing couldn't be more unfortunate. I'm on disability, I get paid one a month, and everything I have goes to paying bills. But because of the issues with my money this month, I haven't been able to pay all my bills. Fortunately I got a small loan to pay my cellphone bill and borrowed money to pay my rent. But what I could not do was pay anything else, and right now that's a huge problem. My niece lives with me and I pay the cable/internet bill. She is doing distance learning and, obviously, need internet access to go to school. Earlier this month I got an extension for the internet service, but now it's due tomorrow. See what I mean about unfortunate timing. But no one will help me and I'm lost. I had to send my niece to my mother's just so she could go to school. But my mother doesn't need the extra hassle, her life is stressful enough as it is. But all of this has taken a toll on me and today has just broken me. Because of the intense stress for the last month, my eczema has flared up on my face, where I've never had it before. My fibromyalgia and IBS have both flared up. I'm just sick to my stomach and I just want to curl up and sleep forever. After all that fighting, my bank is the one that broke me. I can't take anymore stress or I'm going to end up in the hospital. But that looks like what my immediate future is going to be. But, anyway, thanks for letting me vent. I wish I could say I feel better, but I don't. I feel withered up inside and have no more faith or trust in humanity. I know there's a handful of good people out there, but most are not.;Recent events have killed what little motivation I had. Now I'm just sick due to stress. 15 years ago, my life was miserable.

Can Anyone Relate? (33M);Hello, I'm new to this Reddit and as of late, my depression is kicking in full throttle. Over the past few months, I did well, I stayed positive and on path, I was suppose to move to a different state but I had to put those plans on the backburner for now due to a financial situation I hope resolves by October. I feel I have let my friends who were expecting me up there down as they have not spoken to me directly for a few days. We even use to group for games but now it seems they have gone MIA. The real big quicker this week but a possible prospect in dating, only to find out after the first date, she didn't feel a spark, which has put me down even more, I feel like I am destined to be alone. I also suffer from Ulcerative Colitis and now they believe I may have possible kidney disease. After some deep thinking, I have decided not to seek treatment for it, personal reasons. I haven't really thought about suicide, although I do get thoughts that I might be better off not here. I feel like all I do is let people down and have nothing worth mentioning. I try my hardest and end up getting nowhere or something turns the tables to make plans change. I sort of just wanted to relay my thoughts, current situation and hope maybe someone has a way to cope with these feelings.;Can Anyone Relate?

Missing all of my midterms!;So at my school we have Monday of regular classes and then tuesday wednesday and thursday are finals. Well i went into a dangerous heart arrhythmia that afternoon and had to go to the hospital where my 17 year old athletic self almost went into cardiac arrest as i went into Vfib. I had a heart ablation the day after and missed all of my tests. If i wouldn’t of gone to the ER that night i would of gone into Vfib while studying and died within minutes(Sudden Cardiac Death). My teachers are all understanding but now i have to go back to school tomorrow and figure out how to fit 6 1-2 hour tests in 55 minute class periods. I don’t want to miss class tomorrow i need one day back to school after missing three weeks due to winter break and recovery.

I don't know myself outside my mental illness;Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant. EDIT God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first. I hope we all recover and start feeling better soon, you all deserve to be okay. Thanks again to everyone.;I don't know myself outside my mental illness Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant. EDIT God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless.

Is Being Passively Suicidal a Real Thing?;"I once heard a friend of mine saying that her psychiatrist described her as ""passively suicidal."" Idk if that's a real thing or not, but it really perfectly describes my outlook on life. I'll never have a wife or family, very small social circle, my parents are getting older. Soon enough nearly all of my ties to this world will be gone. I generally enjoy my day-to-day, but I really don't have much of a purpose and to be completely honest don't really have any interest in finding one. If I live to 70, I live to 70. If I die at 40, I die at 40. Hell, if I die tomorrow I die tomorrow. It would be a nice change from trying to live up to people's expectations.";"Is Being Passively Suicidal a Real Thing?

You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?;I don't mean just general regret for your life choices.

Lost My Job, Feeling Stressed out and Worthless;f24 I lost my Job recently due to performance, not wanting to damage relationships I had built in my career I decided to quit instead of be fired and drag it all out. I was a great worker and my colleagues loved me, I just couldn't reach the targets they had set for me. I am currently searching for a new career but I am scared and stressed. I feel like everyone is judging me, I feel like I am not contributing. I don't want to change my personality just because I am jobless. But it seems that people expect me to act a different way (namely more housewife focused things like cooking and cleaning). I want to work on my artwork, but every time I do I feel crushing guilt and stress. I am applying for many jobs a day. I am not expecting anyone will even see this, sorry if this is the wrong sub. I am normally a lurker. ;Lost My Job, Feeling Stressed out and Worthless f24 I lost my Job recently due to performance, not wanting to damage relationships I had built in my career I decided to quit instead of be fired and drag it all out.

Very very stupid question] Do you feel better when stressed?;Last time I went to the doctor, the doctor said that stress may be the cause of my symptoms. It doesn't feel right. I feel like I'm fairly calm, and when I'm stressed I actually feel better (not perfectly happy, but not depressed). I've been thinking, but aren't the stressful times supposed to be the bad times when you're already stressed?;Very very stupid question] Do you feel better when stressed?

Sophomore in high school, I don’t care about it anymore and I’m slipping.;For some background I’ve always been a good student. Always in mostly honors (in 6th grade I got kicked out of honors math but it was for the best) and teachers usually like me. But this quarter has just left me completely empty of giving a shit about school. I have a job, I’m in band and jazz band, and I I still like those but I hate school now. I’ve never had this much resentment towards it in my life and I just fucking hate it. I don’t know why or how this started but it’s causing me to slip. This quarter just ended and my lowest grades were C+, one in chemistry and one in my honors English class. My dad told me I need to figure out why I got F’s in certain assignments but I just don’t have the heart to tell him I barely worked on them. I don’t feel like I’m lazy because I’m constantly working, but I’m also not putting in the work. I feel so fucking inadequate, I have friends in way tougher classes that are upset that they have an A-. My parents never praise me for good grades, they only ever bring it up when I have less than adequate. What should I do?

Having a bit of a spiral right now;First time posting here, fairly new to reddit. I've been suffering from depression for years now and have been on many different kinds of medication. Things get bad occasionally and I have a bit of a spiral down. I guess I could feel it coming. I've had issues with work, losing my home (moved in with my bf though so that was a positive but not the way we wanted it because it was a fairly quick decision once I found out I couldn't keep my place anymore after the issues at work), money has been tight the last couple of years but in recent months money has been a massive issue for me, and I've been having some issues with family. I guess things have just been building up a lot. I was managing fine though, trying to keep things together until I made a post this morning on the relationships subreddit asking for advice about this situation with my mum and once comment from someone who had CLEARLY not even read my post was just so hurtful and horrid (even other people said it was unnecessary and they had clearly not even read my post) and it just kind of felt like my brain flipped a switch and I can feel myself just getting worse. I know it was my own fault for posting on reddit because what was I expecting to happen? And now I'm terrified of posting this or looking at my notifications for my other post. I don't know what I expect to get from posting this. Just a rant or something maybe.;Having a bit of a spiral right now First time posting here, fairly new to reddit.

What is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention?;Last night I was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard. She had been out there by herself for several minutes while I was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldn’t flow through it, the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence (they were within three feet of her, and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit. When I finished getting dinner ready, I happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready. Up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and I never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and I was not expecting anything. After I told her dinner was ready I stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy, mowing she might get in my gfs way. She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened. This isn’t the first time she has snapped at me when I am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things I had listed and believed I had come out to hurry her along to dinner. She is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but I think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she can’t.

I am finally home after a year of struggling with comfort in my new house.;After a year living together with my bf our home feels complete. The struggles we have faced such as a bad roommate, money, job issues and the feeling of not being comfortable. I had lived in the same house for my whole life but wanted to move out with my boyfriend. When I did I had such a hard time adjusting. But so much good came out of it. We now live totally alone, brought a dog into our home which we love, my lizards all have play areas outside of their cage and we've gotten so much closer. We're even building our dream business together! My favorite part is we're finally replacing our secondhand couch and mattress!! ( they were from family member times were tough) the best part is we got the mattress of our dreams an adjustable tempur-pedic and got a couch that we both comprised for. My sofa that includes his recliner!! Times were so rough for so long that we thought we weren't going to make it after the lease was over but we grew to understand eachother faults and challenges which made us love eachother even more!!

I didn't understand why other people made it seem so easy, I thought they all had just figured it out or they had been raised with a better work ethic & that I was lazy. I'm not, I suffer from depression and anxiety. I waited until I was 32 to find this out. I waited until I had a major life change, a devastating breakup episode to seek real help other than just counseling.

I am the person that deserves it;I look in the mirror, I immediately start crying. Because I'm lonely and irredeemably ugly. Trying to smear makeup over the tears because they won't stop.

I always will be. I can't put the fork down for a chance at being loved for once in my life. I'm too shy to talk to anyone in person, I think they're conspiring against me. I feel like I'm suffocating whenever I step foot out my front door. I haven't left the house or spoken to or seen another person in months.

They hung up. Three times.;I have dealt with hard times before, but this was the first time I actually called the hotline. I had nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. I needed to talk with someone about it, so I called them. The machine picked up and told me to wait and I would be transferred. I waited and some music started playing, then it stopped after 30 or so seconds. Then 30 seconds later it hung up on me. I tried this three times, same thing every time. I don’t think it means anything, but that third time I was just crying hoping it wouldn’t happen again, but when the music cut out I gave up hope.;They hung up. Three times.

I tried this three times, same thing every time. I don’t think it means anything, but that third time I was just crying hoping it wouldn’t happen again, but when the music cut out I gave up hope.;1;
High functioning depression;I think I have high functioning depression. I can go about my day, socialize, work, etc but inside I just feel so dead, just going through the motions. I shut myself off from feeling anything because I don't want to. When I'm not feeling numb, I'm sad and crying. I'm so tired of feeling this way, never happy or content. Recently during a sad period I managed to open up to a few close friends. That helped a bit. I took some walks and exercised too. But then I woke up the next day and became numb again. Sigh.;High functioning depression I think I have high functioning depression. I can go about my day, socialize, work, etc but inside I just feel so dead, just going through the motions.

Everything is falling apart;My life is falling apart. I got laid off last month ago, my father is going to be unemployed in the coming 2 weeks. My parents are abusive as hell and make life unbearable. My younger siblings have eating disorders and one of them might off herself or die from the damage her body has sustained. I am not able to save anyone or myself. It is like everything that can go wrong is happening.;Everything is falling apart My life is falling apart.

Our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life.;Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe. Did he just say infinite? Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state. Child hood traumas, events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago, can hurt and carry through into our adulthood. Robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity. There is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body. Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease Releasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive. One simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians (channels through which flows energy)((Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force.)) If you are interested into doing this free and simple method here's a [YouTube video]( for you.

Feeling constant Stress and Anxiety!!!;I am just obsessively stressed for the past one and half years. I started my uni last year, and at first, I wanted to give complete attention to my studies. If I got one or two marks less in any quiz or exam, I'd get sad, and I'd stress over that. However, currently, I am learning data science. It's not in my course syllabus. So I am learning a lot of things on my own. I enjoy learning these and working on a project. But the problem is I cannot enjoy the learning process because I am anxious all the time. I am stressing over my future, why I can't learn thing first enough, and even now, I am stressing over the fact that I am stressing. So please suggest to me how can I bring calmness into me and live a peaceful life.;Feeling constant Stress and Anxiety!!! I am just obsessively stressed for the past one and half years.

When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer;When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do. When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood? When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy. When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do. When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed. When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you. When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down. When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable. When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you. How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time - Edit I was not expecting so many people to see and relate to this post but I guess these feelings are more common than any of us thought. As much as I hate that other people are going through the same thing, reading these replies did make me feel a little more understood and a little less alone so thank you all for that.;When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do.

my pain (25F) is overwhelming i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words;i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain. the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying. ;my pain (25F) is overwhelming i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain. the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying. ;1;

Does depression make you want to break-up?;"My (29f) bf (29m) has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year. We have been in a eight year long relationship. He was seeking help for depression 3-4 years ago but he never completed treatment, because he started feeling better soon. One year ago, we hit a rough patch, with him doubting things in our relationship and that i did not love him / cheated on him because i was not fully honest with him regarding some things (which I've apologised for, but i never cheated on him) . He quit his job at the same time and started freelancing for a while, only to resume work two months ago in July 2021. Before starting this job, he did seek professional help (not on my insistence, but because he said he needed help with sleep) He was on lexapro and another medicine for 2-3 months before he ghosted his psychiatrist, saying that the doctor was just ripping him off. He has faced major setbacks in his friendships over the last one year, he doubts most of his friends and doubts their intentions, does not feel happy in general. The reason why i think he is depressed is, I cannot recall a time when he was genuinely happy about anything (maybe apart from when he got this new job, but it soon turned into a stressful situation, since this is not full-time employment yet and his performance will be evaluated after he completes 3 months). Earlier, when he would break up with me, he would come back every other week, saying he does love me and cannot live without me and used to apologise for his behaviour. Since the past few months, his stance has become, ""I never loved you, I was wrong to be with you for eight years, I am sorry I didn't say this earlier, even if I did love you, I don't now. You must move on, I will too"". We still meet each other on the weekends, at times, i am helping him out with his grad-school applications (building resume, SOPs, LORs, essays) and we still do talk on a regular basis, it's just that he will be awfully moody one day and then get started with his ""You should move on, I dont love you"" talk. I am trying to understand which part is true, his depression, or his words. I have told him for now, that we are broken up but the conversation on moving on, is something we can have when he is feeling like himself. Our friends also point out his approach of painting everything in black if anything remotely grey is associated with a thing, and they do call him out, at times. But his recent more fierce stance on saying how he does not love me and never did, makes me wonder if i am the one just living in my own thoughts and things weren't what i think they were. We have spent 8 years together and had every intention of building a future together (which even he has talked about, at times, on multiple occasions in the last one year) I am ready to hold on if it's just his depression talking, I have loved him enough to know I can continue for some more time.

Did this happen to you or is it only me?;Hey! I was having a stressful period, and i had a lot of headaches. But while sleeping, one of the weirdest thing happened to me My brain starts shivering, like I was electrocuted. Some weird thoughts starts coming into my head (subconscious thoughts). The most interesting thing is that I was completely conscious of it happening to the point that I feel like I was the reason of it happening in the first place (like i came up with the thoughts). Also, after it finished (it didn't last long like it felt like 20secs) i was completely conscious with my eyes closed, thinking if i think of good thoughts, and regenerate it again, it will have a different feeling. Weird right. But this is not the first time it happened to me. It happened in a same stress period a year ago. Hopefully guys you can help me figure out it's name, cause I really wanna know if it's harmful. If you experienced the same thing let me know red_heart ;Did this happen to you or is it only me? Hey!

Stressed about MCAT any advice is appreciated;Hey so I have always wanted to go into med school and have just recently graduated from my university with a bachelors degree.

I signed up for Blueprint and they made my free study plan, but I do not want to spend 1,500 just to prepare for this exam. I tried using it in conjunction with Khan Academy, but something about Khan Academy is not helpful, their questions are but not their videos. I was wondering if anyone has some advice for help they could give so I could do well for my MCAT.

I signed up for Blueprint and they made my free study plan, but I do not want to spend 1,500 just to prepare for this exam. I tried using it in conjunction with Khan Academy, but something about Khan Academy is not helpful, their questions are but not their videos. I was wondering if anyone has some advice for help they could give so I could do well for my MCAT. I plan to take it in January;1;
If my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular?;Before the corona virus came I was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor. For me I was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown. During does first 6 months as I had my summer break to I played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where I use to live and I was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months, but whilst does months were going by I started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting. By this time I was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school. The only thing is me being in my room 24-7 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse. At this point I started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like I’m existing in a dead corpse. It got so bad that I cheated on every online work I got and I did not feel bad at all and I still don’t. Even when I had to go in person to do my final exams I knew i was gonna fail them but still didn’t care. Now I’m a freshman in highschool and I honestly can’t see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once I finish school. Bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where I find it hard to speak to new people online. To be honest highschool isn’t the worst I’m glad I get to go in person because it’s forcing me to speak to people however I’ve spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of COVID however I haven’t seen much people talk about it here. In all honesty I’m hoping that does people are right because I’ve had this numbness for 2 years now and I don’t want it to be something I have to live with forever.;If my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular?

The search is finally over folks, It IS possible after all;Well Reddit, after a year and a half of being unemployed I think I finally have gotten a job, from my understanding I start training on Monday at a local coffee shop. And just as I was about to run out of government assistance too. It all does work out in the end it seems, so to those of you still on a search after last years craziness. Keep going strong. It DOES get better.

Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?;"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.";"Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?

“You’re faking your depression because you look happy”;I fucked up. My colleagues/friends at work asked me in which Reddit group I posted the most stuff. And I said in r/depression without thinking. Because my brain is a slow, stupid piece of shit. So they said “Just because you get sad sometimes doesn’t mean you have depression” and “A lot of people are faking depression nowadays” while they both suspiciously looked at me as if I’m some kind of murderer. At work I’m super “bubbly” and “happy” AND IT IS FUCKING EXHAUSTING. After they said all that, I became too awkward to reply. So I walked away, hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again. I just sat on the ground for a bit. Did nothing. Felt like shit but also emotionless. Like I’m floating. Empty, alone and misunderstood. I’m definitely not faking my depression. And it freaking hurts when people don’t believe you because you “seem happy”. I automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though I despise being like that. Faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when I’m finally home I’m just dead in my bed. I’m not positive or bubbly. I’m a negative piece of shit who can’t even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday. +a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on. Yay. Super happy. Ps Sorry, I swear quite a lot when I’m upset.

Everytime i leave my room i am overwhelmed by my family;I am 20 and trying to move out when i get the money. I live with my mum and my younger sister who's 16. They dont tidy up after themselves and i consider myself someone who has to have things tidy to feel normal. Its got to the point where every single time i go downstairs its a mess and i either end up shouting and getting angry or crying. I cant cope with having to constantly clean up after them and i know if i just stop itll build up and be messy. Nobody helps me.

How do I tell her?;"I recently told my mum that I'm depressed. While she's very caring, she has not read up on depression and recognises it only as ""the big sad"". To her, there must be a reason to be depressed, much like when people are sad about something. And while I'm sure many of us do, I can't pinpoint a single reason for me feeling this way. She shows plenty concern, but her remarks like ""don't feel sad, okay? I love you, and the whole family loves you"" annoys me slightly. Mainly because she also makes comments like ""you seem perfectly normal to me"". Idk man, I've seen so many people say that shit and when the person finally takes their life, they regret not acting on what the person told them. In any case, could someone advice me on how I should tell her to either educate herself or explain to her that depression doesn't need a reason? I had previously told her upfront that depression is an illness and I don't know why I feel sad. Guess she's not satisfied with that explanation.

How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+;"Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal. But few define what happiness means, often leading us to chase what our parents, friends, and role models defined as happiness. So when we are back to wearing diapers, we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed. In my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science-backed studies about happiness, I've found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn't. It's like an inverse happiness checklist. In it, you write what doesn't bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness, whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy, doesn't include any of the items from the checklist.  The inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life. So, for example, if you conclude money doesn't bring joy. But you work from 9-9 because ""hustle is life,"" then reduce the number of, say, side projects you have. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated after reaching financial ""freedom"" and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted. Each person's definition of happiness varies. However, most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness. Your definition of happiness cannot reject distress We can't control the decisions and behaviors of humans, animals, or nature. Otherwise, hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn't exist. So no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard, potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner.  To avoid the discomfort from harmful events, some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life. For example, they quit their job to run from their nerve-racking boss. Or switch majors. The issue with this list is its potential size—it's infinite because any event in our lives can distress us. A more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life. And realizing happiness can coexist with events that don't match our definition of a perfect activity, day, or life. For example, a harmless event like Microsoft Word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day. Or it could become a fun challenge to overcome. When you welcome distress, you experience two benefits. First, you become used to different causes of discomfort, reducing their chances of affecting you. Second, you realize distress can (and must) coexist with happiness.    Your definition of happiness cannot come from others Most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us, leading to repentance during our deathbed. For example, some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents, while others seek minimalism according to a monk's advice.  In college, psychologists, doctors, and nurses taught me around 80% of older people under palliative care regretted their lives' choices. But you don't need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life. So instead, change it today.  First, write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life. You can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them. Second, answer the most crucial question ""who's someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness?""  Ask yourself one last question ""Is this goal worth pursuing even though X person shares it?""  Contrast your answer with other items from your checklist. So if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside (goal), your friends feel the same (influence), but your inverse checklist says you *don't* like being away from the city, then stop pursuing that goal. Avoid being miserable on your deathbed. While your DNA differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life's choices on their deathbeds, you may be following another person's definition of happiness—just like they did. Unfortunately, the old and sick don't have the strength to change their lives drastically. But you do.  So start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept, one *you* truly believe.  **Share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below.** If you are not comfortable doing it publicly, please DM me on Twitter at @ MrNicolasForero — I'm curious to discover what you would add.";"How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+ Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal.

I’m getting super depressed and I’m afraid I’m out of manic days where I can get at least something done. My apartment is disgusting and my laundry is piling up. I’m alone and I keep talking and hooking up with my ex’s to not feel so alone. Sleeping by myself is one of the most exhausting things I’ve done, I just don’t have anyone to curl into and cry.

Does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they can't get rid of?;Maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain.

I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality;Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it. I keep hearing things that I’m not sure are really there, like incoherent whispering, humming, creaking or breathing. I have really vivid, disturbing hallucinations while I’m on the verge of sleep that make me afraid to go to bed at night, the slightest sound panicking me. I’m an excessive daydreamer (not something I want to get rid of) which means I’m constantly in my own head, but it’s becoming harder and harder to control my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll become so entrenched in a mental argument I’ll be motionless for up to half an hour at a time, sometimes to the point of tears. I’ve tried all that ‘mindfulness’ stuff and it doesn’t help me whatsoever, if anything it only stresses me out more. I’m scared to seek help because I don’t want to be seen as “just another attention seeking teenager,” and have already been dismissed by my mother when I shared my concerns. My dad has depression himself and I don’t want to stress him out any more. There’s nobody else I’m particularly close to. At this exact moment I’m the only one still awake at my house and every little sound around me is freaking me out. I’ve had a strange feeling building up for weeks, I can only compare it to the feeling you have when you’re dreaming and only a part of you knows it. Of course I know this is reality, but that feeling won’t go away.;I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday;"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding... He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die"" I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back. He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone. I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life. Edit Thank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these. Thank you";"Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD.

Freshman in uni for 2 weeks but I´m already stressed and exhausted;"I´ve been studying for just 2 weeks in university, but it´s already too much for me. Everytime a lesson starts, we get an assigment. I already have to make 5 assigments and 7 presentations. I have to finish two presentations until Thursday, I have to finish my assigment before Tuesday, and I also have a presentation on Wednesday (my ADHD isn´t really helping me either). And I have to find a free day to go to the doctor´s, because I might have celiac disease. It´s been just two weeks, and it´s already too much. I´m already feeling anxious all the time about the quality of the assigments. I don´t have time to chill out. I constantly feel exhausted, my back hurts, and I´m irritated and agressive all the time. I´ve already gave up on all of my hobbies. I barely talk to anyone. I sleep for 4 or 5 hours, because I have so much homework to do. My mom keeps threatening me with kicking me out if I don´t meet her expectations. She keeps demanding more and more from me, but I just can´t keep up with her requirements. She also keeps making threats to throw out my headphones whenever I wear them outside. And she keeps trying to read all my messages and she wants to know about everything I do. When I asked her why, she just said that it´s for my own sake. She is so controlling that everytime she hears me type on a keyboard, she comes to my room to check if I´m writing an assigment. And if I´m not, she hits me, screams at me and tells me to get to it, and that she wants me to have more pages written than what professors required. She keeps telling me to find a job, which I want to do, only if I had more time. And now, on top of my father´s alimonies, she now requires monthly payments of half of what he sends in monthly, and she is expecting me to pay for internet and TV. My girlfriend thinks that it´s funny and cute when I´m angry or frustrated, so she keeps trying to make me even angrier by any means. When I asked her if she even cares about how I feel, she just laughed and said that ""Yeah, I care about you, but it´s funny to watch you get angry."". We are in a long distance relationship, and when I try to call her in the evenings to talk about stuff, she just says that she is out with friends or that she is too tired to talk to me, even when she promises me to talk to me the day before. I straight up told her ""We should break up if all I´m good for is the amusement you get out of my struggles."", and she just said ""Nah, I like watching you get mad for no reason."". She´s really pushing our relationship to the edge of breakup, but I don´t want to stay alone, because frankly, I have no friends left, and she is my last person left that I can even remotely consider a friend. I nearly busted into tears in front of a crowd of people today. I can barely hold it all back. Even my new classmates keep wondering about why am I so down all the time, because for them, it´s a walk in the park. Yeah, for me it´s a walk in a park as well, but the park is on fucking fire, because it´s a park near Satan´s flaming balls. Everybody wants too much from me, and I can´t carry that burden.

I don't know how to get help;From mobile. Please forgive any errors. I have been suffering slight depression for years now. Mostly loneliness and I suppose from the general sense of responsibility. I am the sole breadwinner for my parents. Im doing OK but it always feels like it will never stop. I see no plausible way how my life can get better. I don't want to go deep into all my issues. But thr gist is I'm doing my job but I am not happy. I feel guilty when I feel sad because I have so many good things in my life. I feel like I should not be complaining. I want to happy. But I don't know how to be. I wish I could. Whenever I think about it, I feel like the only way I can be at peace is if the whole world just ends. I know it's a horrible thing to say. I'm not suicidal because that will not solve anything for me. I want to take care of my parents. Im no use to them if I'm dead. I tried getting help with a mental health professional to better cope with whatever I'm going thru. But she rated me as a moderately severe depressed person and said she would send me details to a therapy group. But she never did. Just forgot. It just feels like everyone has abandoned me to deal with my problems. I want to be able to handle my troubles better myself. But it would be so nice to have someone who is willing to help. To care. I don't know what to do to get rid of this feeling that I will never be happy. And the only consolation is that the world may end someday and I don't have to deal with it anymore.;I don't know how to get help From mobile. Please forgive any errors.

Don’t want to sleep because tomorrow will come faster;All I want to do is get in bed and sleep forever, but I can’t seem to bring myself to sleep because that will just bring tomorrow faster and that is worse than just lying here exhausted.

I hate that it feels like I can't even post on Reddit;"I get anxious about things like people downvoting my posts or saying negative things to me. There is a series that has it's own odd logic, like milk being used to have a character's tooth grow back (as I was reminded of nicely.) I then mentioned how lately in this series, a character's skull has become cracked (it showed an x-ray type of shot of it and everything.) And I asked if milk would be enough to heal this character's cracked skull this time. And someone responded to me with ""Oh, so you're a shit poster then. Or just stupid.""

Burst into tears because of Animal Crossing;I’ve been having a really rough few months and my depression’s been more intense than usual, so I got animal crossing 2 weeks ago in hopes of it calming me down when it gets bad. A new villager just moved onto my island, and it started singing while staring at the lake. I started crying because it was just so pure and cute that it made me realize how fucking depressed I am. Social distancing, being quarantined, not seeing my friends, becoming recently single, on top of my mental illnesses have been so overwhelming. I’m so tired of being alive and I wish these feelings would just stop.;Burst into tears because of Animal Crossing I’ve been having a really rough few months and my depression’s been more intense than usual, so I got animal crossing 2 weeks ago in hopes of it calming me down when it gets bad.

So many people have told me that they care and that I need to keep them in my life;I live across the ocean from my home country and it's very isolating. I always felt so alone. Recently I have come to my country and visiting aunts, cousins, siblings that I have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself. Even cousins that I haven't had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how I'm doing and so and so. I never knew they cared about me like this. Im going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy. I dont know how to explain but it really gives me comfort. I have been so down before that I had to be hospitalized for a week and I felt that no one cared, but I know that it's not the truth. Family is the most important to me and I feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life. The support I am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me, that they know I deserve better is overwhelming great. I feel like before people gaslighted the shit out of me, saying I was making a big deal out of nothing and things like that. To not be laughed at is amazing. It feels a lot easier to let go of my traumas with the support I am receiving.;So many people have told me that they care and that I need to keep them in my life I live across the ocean from my home country and it's very isolating.

Mini-burnouts;Hi, I'm dealing with a hard-to-grasp psychological problem. The pattern is somewhat like this I'm always highly stimulated. Sometimes I'm tempted to work too hard, and end up in some sort of mini-burnout. This happens about once a week, and leaves me foggy and unmotivated (dopamine-depleted?) for about 2 days. I have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this. When I'm overly excited, it inhibits me (probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited), but I don't feel any anxiety. I'm often hardly aware of how stimulated I am. Sometimes, I am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode, work my ass off, try to complete my whole to-do list in one day.This pretty much instantly triggers a mini-burnout. This also happens when I drink just one cup of coffee. Except when I'm socially active then I can take all the stimulants I want and be fine. Weird. This state has gone on for about 2 years, and I still haven't been able to make sense of it. Maybe there's a blindspot somewhere. Anyway, other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me, I have a question about a specific solution I have in mind. My defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down, through reframing my situation as easy, meditating, ignoring my to-do list, etc. Now I have a suspicion that this mini-burnout is emotional or motivational in nature. That I'm not actually chemically depleted, but that there's a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that I go down. Or alternatively that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach. It would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions. Reframing my high stress as excitement, instead of anxiety. Maybe that will make the stress less chronic. But I'm afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place, because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal, thereby increasing it. And that would be extremely high-cost, for I've been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout. Could anyone shine their light on this? Any progress on this problem would be major for me. Thank you.;Mini-burnouts Hi, I'm dealing with a hard-to-grasp psychological problem. The pattern is somewhat like this I'm always highly stimulated.

Or alternatively that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach. It would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions. Reframing my high stress as excitement, instead of anxiety. Maybe that will make the stress less chronic. But I'm afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place, because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal, thereby increasing it. And that would be extremely high-cost, for I've been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout. Could anyone shine their light on this? Any progress on this problem would be major for me. Thank you.;1;
When I get stressed out I feel like I’m hearing voices yelling in my head;When I get overwhelmed and anxious I feel like there are a million thoughts in my head that I can’t control. It feels like yelling and even sounds I can’t explain. There is pressure around my ears and kind of a ringing sound, and I get a feeling at the bottom of my back. My brain feels all jumbled like someone is stirring it. I’ll be studying and it’s so hard to focus on school when this happens.;When I get stressed out I feel like I’m hearing voices yelling in my head When I get overwhelmed and anxious I feel like there are a million thoughts in my head that I can’t control.

Can't stop thinking of my parents getting older;I live a decent distance from my parents. I have a good relationship with them and all, but I don't feel like we're close or have much of anything in common. I get anxious when I think of calling them because I don't know what to say. I work in IT for a living and at this point all I do is pretty much work, and my parents are the furthest bit from understanding what I do, so we have nothing to talk about except the past. I'm in my mid-20's but my Dad is pushing 60 and moms on her way too. Both are in okay shape but I know that it's going to come one day.... I toss in bed thinking of them getting older and knowing one day that they'll be gone. I don't know how to connect to them let alone anyone except my wife nowadays and branching outside of that social circle gets me anxious. Anyone else have the same issues?;Can't stop thinking of my parents getting older I live a decent distance from my parents.

I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.;It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there? Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them? Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from? How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die.;I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.

How to calm the body down?;Does anyone find their body flares up in a stress response at any kind of deviation from equilibrium?

I just don’t know how to calm it down. I do yoga, I journal, I nap if I feel I need to, I try to say no to social events I don’t really want to go to, I take Xanax as and when I need - I mostly just ride it out and try and take care of myself but sometimes these symptoms get in the way of things I need to do!

Stressed, but for no reason?;"Hi there! I was wondering if anyone may have some wise words, or advice on how I could possibly manage chronic stress, when I have it for no reason! I seem to have all the symptoms; I can't sleep more than 5 hours a night, and wake up constantly, I have a ""stress belly"", I feel anxious often, and I am forgetful. I feel I am also exhausted when it comes to relationships, zero sex drive and often feel anxious. However... I can't understand why? I am pretty lucky in my life, and have a roof over my head, good friends and food in my fridge. I exercise a moderate amount, eat a healthy diet with lots of fruit and veggies, and I am pretty good at getting a work-life balance (I think!). I have hobbies I enjoy, and spend time socialising, and I am not really stressed out with university or work. However I just feel like there is a constant stress in my stomach. So does anyone have any idea of where I am going wrong... or if there is anything I can do? I really want to feel less anxious and tired!

I have a friend who is talking about self harm, I need to know what to do to help them.;Hey Reddit I was told here would be a good place to post this, as I said in the title I have this friend who is talking about self harm and I don’t know what to do. He told me yesterday that “I honestly dont know what im doing but i might not see you tommorow - or the day after that- or ever but if i do anything drastic (dont know if i will) just know its better for the world and the people around me” this was the only mention of suicide that he has told me directly but he has also made a lot of self harm jokes and vented about how much of a failure and disappointment he thinks he is. He says he hasn’t eaten or slept in four days I don’t know how I can help them. I just can’t handle both my emotions and trying to help him work through his Some added info He’s a trans man (hasn’t come out yet) in a family that is very likely not to accept him. He also told me (a trans girl) he loved me and I told him I only liked him as a friend, I know if I told them I loved them then that would probably help them but I don’t want to lie, he hasn’t mentioned anything about him harming himself because I only like him so I don’t think he’s manipulating me as one person suggested. We are both still living with our families and so trying to get someone like a therapist is a bit harder.

I've tried but I don't know what else to do;"Sorry for the new throwaway account but I don't want any of my family or friends to know this is me Background info I'm a 16 year old female, school for me starts in about 2 weeks (a little less) TW for mentions of suicide - Okay so...

Death anxiety sucks.;About a year ago I started to get anxiety about death. It never really bothered me before that. It’s not dead people, or what it must feel like to be dead. I love Halloween, graveyards, the ghost stories. And I do not believe the dead know that they’re dead. It‘s the process of dying that gets me. I think about people who were murdered, and how bleak and awful that must be. For your last moments to be filled with fear as someone completely behind reason causes you mortal pain and injury. For your final experience to be the not only the worst, but the loneliest. It must be like the worst panic attack you’ve ever had, times a thousand. And then, however quickly it happens, you start to lose consciousness and you know “this is really it”. and then you’re gone.;Death anxiety sucks.

When does stress become a “disability” or can it? Help/Advice welcome;Hi there, I am brand new to this sub. I honestly searched Reddit for a stress sub bc I don’t know who else to ask (short of going to my doctor - which I’m not sure is warranted). I have been out of work throughout the pandemic and while it carried its own type of stressors I noticed after awhile that I had little to no heat burn, rarely experienced migraines anymore, and even my asthma seemed to subside. I have surmised that they were all in someway triggered by stress/anxiety. Of course I have been searching for a new job but out of fear from the pandemic I wasn’t in desperation mode. Now over a year out it just seems like time and I’ve been more heartily searching. I have multiple interviews coming up and while I haven’t consciously stressed over it, but I have noticed that I have been experiencing indigestion and last night I had the worst migraine of my life. Pandemic aside, I have enjoyed my free time over this last year and after last night I’m afraid to go back to that level of stress. Anyone have any suggestions? Should I talk to my doctor? It’s all kind of circumstantial. I’m single so I need some kind of income but I don’t want it to come at my health’s expense.;When does stress become a “disability” or can it?

Darkest before the dawn, right?;Struggling with stress for 2 months now. Coaching sessions only focus on the thoughts and how to take control of my wandering mind and all the overwhelming thoughts that keep piling up. But what I'm now facing is a whole different kind of monster... The physical reactions and symptoms now with dizziness, constant headache from tension in neck and shoulders and the dark and gloomy thoughts of all the possible complications and deceases that may follow a period of stress illness. My mood is around 0 and all my thoughts are on the above. When I force myself to do other stuff, like briefly play with my kids or focus on a cup of coffee, I feel a bit more relaxed. But as soon as my mind is not actively focused on something else, I slip back into darkness. Basically I am just writing this, hoping that someone can reassure me, that others have felt the same and got better? Or maybe share some things that have helped others progress and move past it into brighter times?;Darkest before the dawn, right? Struggling with stress for 2 months now. Coaching sessions only focus on the thoughts and how to take control of my wandering mind and all the overwhelming thoughts that keep piling up. But what I'm now facing is a whole different kind of monster... The physical reactions and symptoms now with dizziness, constant headache from tension in neck and shoulders and the dark and gloomy thoughts of all the possible complications and deceases that may follow a period of stress illness. My mood is around 0 and all my thoughts are on the above. When I force myself to do other stuff, like briefly play with my kids or focus on a cup of coffee, I feel a bit more relaxed. But as soon as my mind is not actively focused on something else, I slip back into darkness. Basically I am just writing this, hoping that someone can reassure me, that others have felt the same and got better? Or maybe share some things that have helped others progress and move past it into brighter times?;1;
Need advice on my mood;I have suffered mental issues all my life (32m), I had anorexia at 13, panic attacks also. I suffer sleep anxiety from the age of 15 , racing thoughts at night..used to go 5-6 days without sleep. I’ve been on mirtazapine since February and they have been a godsend, i am now able to sleep for once in my life. I feel like I’ve hit another obstacle in my life, I just generally feel unhappy with life. I constantly worry about my girlfriends happiness which is putting a big strain on my relationship. I find i spiral out of control easily with my emotions , all it takes is something i dont agree with and I find myself in a pit of despair. I constantly argue with co workers. I always feel like I’ve forgotten to do something when there isn’t anything out standing. I feel empty inside, just surviving Im unsure what type of help I need , would counselling be right for me?;Need advice on my mood I have suffered mental issues all my life (32m), I had anorexia at 13, panic attacks also.

No one cared when I attempted suicide;Back in February of 2019 I attempted suicide after a painful heartbreak and a series of friendships ending. I reached out to people while I was recovering in hospital but no one responded. In the 3 weeks I was in hospital my mum was the only person that came to visit me. Since then I have been blocked by most people and the few that didn't still haven't responded. I'm not really surprised by any of this but it still hurts knowing that I could have killed myself and no one would have cared.;No one cared when I attempted suicide Back in February of 2019 I attempted suicide after a painful heartbreak and a series of friendships ending.

Functional depression;Anyone else have functional depression? Not even sure if that’s a real thing. But I still go about my daily activities, work, exercise, hobbies school etc. but nothing really excites me or makes me happy anymore. I still get out of bed but there’s just this empty void of nothingness that I can’t seem to feel no matter what I do. I just feel kinda dull and as if I’m just going through the motions. Been feeling this since November( my last month on antidepressants). Currently I’m not super depressed or suicidal, but can’t really say I ever feel truly happy either.;Functional depression Anyone else have functional depression? Not even sure if that’s a real thing.

I’ve been addicted to countless forms of SH over the years; substances, self mutilation, eating disorders, etc. Things finally started looking up for me when I went to treatment for my ED last year but then I developed multiple chronic illnesses and had to stop going as I now exist in a perpetual state of stomach pain, nausea, exhaustion, nerve pain, etc. My college plans were thrown for a loop because of my current health state and I have surgery in November that have a high chance of making things worse.

Not Sure What To Do;So a little background. First, this isn't my main Reddit account and the name is coincidental... but accurate. Second, I've suffered from pretty extreme anxiety for pretty much my whole life, but it's only really been the last 2-3 years I've suffered from the kind of symptoms you would generally associate with bad depression. And the last week has sent me over the edge in both regards. I'm falling behind in college even though it's a subject I should, and do, love. I feel my a few of my teachers are complete assholes, and events in my life during the last week have really put me down. Between all that, I'm honestly having a panic attack right now about class this morning. To be honest, the events of the last week turned my depression into the realm of suicide ideation. I hate to say that, but I have thought about it. I had to take my father to the hospital, and I didn't know if he was going to come back. And then my mother found stuff which didn't paint him in a great light. I've felt like complete crap ever since. I'm calling a doctor today after class today, and I'm going to get help. I don't want to live like this, and I can't. I can't keep feeling the way I do, because I know it is a path to self-destruction, and I don't know if it's me specifically or the rest of the world or a combination. All I know is I need help, I can't do it myself. I hate asking for help but I need it. I dunno. I'm not sure what to do. I don't have anyone to turn to or talk to. Sorry for most likely wasting your time, I just had to get it off my chest. I hope they can help me.;Not Sure What To Do So a little background.

when is it my turn for people to care about me;I feel like my mom has always loved my brothers more. she hates talking to me and has always been kinder to them. she held them accountable when they were younger, made them do their chores, get a job, whatever. obviously this taught them work ethic and self accountability but she seemingly doesn’t care to do the same with me. I have a few close friends but sometimes I wonder if they actually care or only seem to care because they’re afraid to be mean. I feel useless, like I’ll never go anywhere and there’s no point in trying. I feel stupid, I’m just the dumb kid to laugh at how dumb he is. I feel awkward, no girl would want anything to do with me because I’m fucking weird, but not even a good, goofy weird. Just weird.;when is it my turn for people to care about me I feel like my mom has always loved my brothers more. she hates talking to me and has always been kinder to them. she held them accountable when they were younger, made them do their chores, get a job, whatever. obviously this taught them work ethic and self accountability but she seemingly doesn’t care to do the same with me.

I feel like a suicide attempt is the only way to make people care.;I live in a country where depression isn’t taken too seriously. People just think I’m “going through a hard time” or “feeling down.” They don’t understand just how serious the circumstances are. Just to clarify, I don’t want to commit suicide (though I have seriously considered it). However, I do think that if I made a suicide attempt, then people’s perspectives would change. I know it’s an irrational way of thinking, but I’m getting to a point where I’m running out of options. Edit Did not expect this to blow up... Thank you to everyone who gave their advice/support.

Why do I miss the comfort of being depressed?;I used to be depressed 2 years back. I have since recovered with the help of lifestyle changes and medication. I've realised how fucked up my head was when I was depressed and now I see how much more light there is. But there are times that my thoughts wander and I start having those all consuming negative thoughts and suicidal ideation. Im aware though that I'm not actually depressed now. It's like I'm neither here nor there, I'm never really happy or never really sad. And I kind of miss being depressed. I miss the comfort of knowing there's nothing truly ahead of me and the inevitable death. Does this make sense to anyone?

I stood up for myself and I'm so happy!!;Omg, I finally stood up to the resident manager who is rude and disrespectful towards me and only talks to my fiance even when I'm right there (I'm the owner of my apt). The last straw was when my fiance told him to let me know (twice) what's going on but I didn't get anything at all. So I calmed my broiling self down and spoke to him over the phone, he gave me some BS about not having my number (we have texted each other!!) and I wanted to rip him a new one.

They are offering a free summer camp just for the smart kids AND providing transporation!! I really love the transportation factor because I just got a new job and i have no way of picking her up on time, thankfully... they have a special bus just for the kids that will pick them up and take her home. The bus stop is within few of my doorstep so I dont have to worry about her walking home alone either. Its really like God answered my prayers this year. I stress about summer almost all year and it was great to get a letter that she had been chosen for this special program. I think it was partly because covid had a every kid struggling a bit and left a lot of kids unprepared for advanced placement in their next grade level. They will be feeding them for free as well.. another bonus for my pockets. I couldnt be happier for her or more excited!;I am a single mom and I struggle with what to do with my kid on summer breaks.

Could my depression be lack of food+nutrition?;Hi all, so I’m a depressed individual who is unmedicated. I have taken another turn for the worst and wanted to share some observations. I have always been a very skinny dude. I wake up, drink coffee, and don’t eat for at least 2 hours. My job is very physically demanding. I do manage to eat 3 meals a day, but are small portions, maybe 1 piece of fruit and rarely vegetables. I’m nearly 6 feet at 150 pounds, over the last 6 months I’ve maintained 142 pounds and my depression has worsened. (Extreme negative thoughts, hopelessness, thoughts of suicide, afraid to go to store/errands, lack of self worth).. I’m come to realize my depression may be linked to a low serotonin issue. I found this out because I’ve taken molly, mushrooms, and I feel fantastic on these substances. I also feel really good after exercise. All serotonin increasing things. What my life has always lacked is a balanced diet. I eat because I have to, not because I really enjoy it. And I notice that with everyone around me. I did some research that 70-80% of serotonin is produced in the gut. And if I’m constantly not getting enough serotonin producing foods, I might be screwing myself from the get go. I drink casually, once during the week and once on weekend, few drinks at a time. I’m a carpenter so I get enough exercise. I have friends I see often, a good family, a good job. I don’t want to go on an SSRI just yet. Has anyone had much luck with altering their diet, putting on a few pounds? Tired of this, I should be happy.;Could my depression be lack of food+nutrition?

My family searched my room while I was in the hospital;I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer. The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in. He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. ;My family searched my room while I was in the hospital I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer.

They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. ;1;

20y male stressed out about feeling stuck;Moved down to my parents place after some stuff went down with my aunt. Now not making as many hours and still no one is teaching me to drive. I’m stuck in Georgia not able to do anything bc I’m not making enough money and I can’t drive so my options are very limited. Used to making 350 usually with my aunt now only making around 120 or 160 at Kroger and my stress is through the roof messing with my social life and my mental health in general. Really relying on the second stimulus check to hopefully make it through the year.;20y male stressed out about feeling stuck Moved down to my parents place after some stuff went down with my aunt.

Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...;I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don’t understand. There are days that I’m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don’t want to live like this. I’m done. I apologize for doing this here. I have nowhere else to do this. If you read this, God bless you and thank you. You treat me better than my family. I never thought people would pay attention to this, but you did. Thank you. I fell asleep last night trying to reply to every one of you, but I see now that there’s a lot. Thank you so much. You’ve all given me some things to consider. Thank you, each and every one of you. I never dreamed I would even get a reply. I just thought it would be like it is at home. Thank you. You’ve made a grown man cry. This means a lot.;Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...

Unwanted and unworthy;No one wants me here. I have one friend and she continuously flakes on me. Ditches me to go do things with her other friends and doesn't even have the decency to tell me she isn't showing up so I sit there like an idiot for hours on end waiting for a response that will never come. I got a new job, a new house, am going to school. I have been fighting tooth and nail to make my life better...make some friends...be less of a burden. But nothing helps. Every day is worse and I can't keep doing this alone. There has only been one person who ever treated me well and it turns out he was cheating and manipulating me the whole time. I need a break. I need some air. And I need somebody who cares, but that person just isn't coming.;Unwanted and unworthy No one wants me here. I have one friend and she continuously flakes on me.

Where does stress come from?;It is perhaps an accepted fact that stress is usually brought on by outside forces.  This is so ingrained in most people’s mindsets, that the slightest inconvenience or signs of being pushed out of the comfort zones will get some negative reactions from the body, and that would be considered stress. Generally outside forces are blamed for the internal turmoil that stress is supposed to cause.   Where Is It When life in general does not unfold the way we perceive it should, determines the stress levels we experience.

My (27M) dad (58M) killed himself and it's my fault;My dad lived far away and I lived independently after a lot of quarrel with my relatives whom I stayed with for a while (long story, deserves its own post). Despite effectively being banished from the rest of the family, I was still in good terms with my dad. One day he asked for money, said it was to start a business there and that I'd get a share of the income. I was struggling with my own career and even financially but I found my way to send the amount he requested anyway. I was even jobless (too ashamed to admit it) when I sent the money. A month passed, and there was no update on the business. I followed up and he said he was busy, there was some delay, etc. Even more months passed and there was barely anything. I chatted/texted him and he said he'll just return the money when he can. Turns out that he was financially struggling there as well. I was able to find employment eventually but I was paranoid. I don't have any savings on my own nor any emergency money. My sick leaves are unpaid and I will not have income if I'm sick with covid. I kept asking him if he could send even a fraction of that amount. I told him that I can't even find work-from-home setups as I can't afford the equipment needed. He said he still couldn't send any amount at all. I was mad. I told him of all the times he told me I should've forgiven the family, obey them blindly, and so on. And here we are now in a situation where they're not even helping him. I urged him to just borrow from them. They're well off, I'm not. I'm surviving by own monthly income with barely any savings. Plus I had to borrow a bit of money to send him which I still have to pay off. He kept apologizing. Said he's trying to find a way. I was losing my patience. I kept following-up every week or so. Sometimes months. I was also pissed because family already banished me and I feel like I'm being forced to join this problem. I had no reason to mistrust my dad and I'm sure he genuinely needed help. But the clan could help him better than I could. One day he texted saying he can pay me back soon. The next day I learned that he killed himself. I didn't want this to happen... I know more context or info is needed so I'll edit and comment along the way. I'm still shaken by this.;My (27M) dad (58M) killed himself and it's my fault My dad lived far away and I lived independently after a lot of quarrel with my relatives whom I stayed with for a while (long story, deserves its own post).

As my depression lifted, the world seem to change around me;I have a story that I’d like to share. I think it pretty accurately reflects how depression shaded my world, and how that changed once I started to get better. I’ve been lurking here a while, and want to let people know that things can get better. I had been in a rut for several years. It got to the point where I could barely get out of bed. I don’t know exactly what changed, but I decided that I had had enough, and would do what I could to get better. For me, this took the form of quitting smoking (I was up to a pack a day), and going out for jogs. I was in university at the time. There was a lagoon on campus, a small lake that was next to the ocean, about 1.5 miles around. I decided this would be a good place to try running laps. I was AWFUL. Out of shape, could barely breathe, and was only able to run for a few minutes at a time without my lungs and legs screaming to stop. I was certain I must have looked awful and that everybody was judging me. But I kept at it. I noticed this woman out there, walking laps. She was an old woman, with nasty hair, sagging skin, and she wore these horrible flip-flops, which revealed toe nails that definitely needed clipping. “What a hag”, I would think to myself. “Why is she even out here?” As I started going out there regularly, I saw her almost every day. Eventually, I started to wave to her as I would pass. The first few times, she didn’t notice. But eventually, she would wave back. Then, I started smiling and waving, and she would smile and wave back. It became a part of my routine to wave and smile at her while out on my runs. She was working almost just as hard as I was, getting out there every day. I was getting close to graduation, and this would be my last run around that lagoon. So when I saw her that day, I stopped and started to talk to her. We introduced ourselves. She told me that she had lost her husband a few months prior to a heart attack, and that she was hoping to get into shape so that she could get healthier and live long enough to see her grandchildren grow up. This interaction brought me to the brink of tears. The woman looked nothing like when I first saw her. She was smiling, had a glow of positivity about her, and even got herself some proper footwear! As I got better, the way I saw and interacted with the world also got better. I imagine that this woman’s view of me as an overweight slob who could barely breathe trying to run might have improved as she got better too. You are not alone.

Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me;"Context I am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety. I have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together. My friends say I’m not an unlikable person, I have some hobbies including reading and writing, I’m told I’m pretty funny and as far as I know my friends and family like having me around, however I tend to be more on the introverted side and don't always take to people right away. I also don’t think I’m necessarily ugly, just not attractive. I have a skinny build, I'm 5'10"", etc. etc. I've gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me. I have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them, so it's not like I am someone who never puts themselves out there. During quarantine, a bunch of friends and I downloaded Tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartments/homes. Nothing really came of it, but I quickly realized that I wasn't having the same experience as all my other friends. They were getting tons of matches and likes, and I was only getting a few likes/matches. All the conversations I had with matches never seemed to go anywhere, despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice. When I brought up my lack of likes/matches to my friends, they tried ""overhauling"" my profile to be more like theirs, but there was no change. Tonight a couple friends and I were hanging out and they were all swiping through Tinder (and getting matches) while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookup/hangout. Obviously I had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there, scrolling through Tinder while watching my friend next to me get 3 matches in a row. I felt awful. I'm just so tired of it all. I wasn't worried in high school about girls/relationships as I figured I'd have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things, but I'm coming to realize that people are just not interested in me. I feel like I've tried everything, and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up. I'm scared because I feel that after I graduate, it's only going to be that much harder to meet people. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone is/has been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice.";"Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me Context I am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety.

I have just graduated from high school and my mother is asking me to help pay for rent, I don't have any skill I have only just started learning to code whereas both my sister had a few year break and is playing games 24/7 even right now they are playing. Although one is studying biomedical whenever she have free time is just games. My parents doesn't have much money left and we r just barely getting by but my parents continue to buy useless/ unnecessary snack, coffee etc. Also my mother likes to waste water by cleaning the floor multiple times with just only water (OCD) not soap even when I have already clean it. I have also already told them many many times (throughout 11 - 18yo) to not buy any more snack, and have told my mother that washing with water does not really clean the area and also told my sister to help out with the chores at least. But my effort is all for nothing, I have only added extra stress in my life. Is it wrong to think that this is unfair or am I being in the wrong here? Because when I'm telling my sister to learn some skill instead of playing games they get defensive and started to argue with me. I didn't force them to learn I'm just telling them that they should learn something instead of playing games whole day My parents father 60+yo, mother 50+yo both have not work for a really long time. I won't and can't tell them to work because they r my parents, and I'm still living under their roof I have already gave up telling them what to do, because of this I have learned that you can't actually tell people what to do if they not willing to listen, and change. I'm In constant stress, my parents doesn't allow me to work because of Covid. So instead while I still have roof under my head I'm doing everything I can to learn the necessary coding skill / graphic design so I can start working. When I was younger I told my mother I will help with the rent but that was a year ago I didn't really think that through, my mistake on my part. Now my mother is guilt tripping me to pay for the rent. I'm using my allowance and am also out of cash ( shouldn't even be called allowance since I'm technically returning the money ) Because of this stress, I'm also constantly thinking why do so many people have a child when they are not financially stable or mentally prepared to be a parent. What do people expect when they have a child? Isn't it just a cycle, baby, adolescent, teenager > go college, young adult > start working, old adult > retired and have a child. Then cycle repeats again and again. In my case my parent want me to continue the family name. What would your advice be? Am I being a spoiled child? Note My parents is loving but to me they r not ready to be a parent. ( They always argue, talk about money in front of me and my sister, not telling my sister to do any chore. Etc ). I don't have any driving license and my parents are also quite strict I quite embarrassed to say this but I cant ride on a public bus without their permission first. I had my Covid shot but parent still won't let me work outside.My sister is not helping to pay rent, I can't tell them what to do because they will go defensive and we will be in an argument again Don't have to sugar coat your answer, I'm also writing here so that I can improve on myself.

Help me with what?;"New throwaway I guess Some background I'm a young adult, have had lifelong diagnosed depression along with diagnosed anxiety and two past psychotic episodes one being due to unspecified worsening depression and one being ER psychosis. No legitimate suicide attempts, only recurrent 'SI'. I don't even really know what to say except my life is beautiful and I'm so ugly. Can't even laugh without smoking weed these days and now that I haven't been able to smoke for a week or so due to pending responsibility I'm feeling peculiarly dead inside. All I feel on the daily basis is pain from chemo meds, anger from nowhere, and the familiar lukewarm void that is walking depression. My sleep and mental health have been in a downward spiral due to an overnight trip I took recently and it's causing my chronic pain to flare up. Over this summer I've degenerated into a slow and unintelligent version of myself. I've been so angry about, well, everything. I get angry at any videogame with the slightest hint of a competitive aspect, I get angry at the love of my life over trivial things, and I get angry at myself for being useless, depressed, and unemployed for several months now. When I'm not angry I become lachrymose and apathetic while the icy waves of nothing numb me to the bone and the prickly sand turns my flesh to ash. Today I had what is usually a great day, I spent time with my boyfriend. Normally cuddling, gaming, and watching the television turn my worst days to gold, however, I felt nothing; the few good moments he wrenched out of my corpse were quickly consumed up by the little black hole inside my brain's labyrinth. Today my soul became an arid desert drought of tears. God what I would not give to cry, I'd rather cry than cum or savor soft warm food. When he dropped me off at my house I didn't know what to feel, if anything at all came. I ambled toward my parent's house and calmly watched a frog from the nearby lake jumping across our driveway as herds of others do in this season. The nothing I felt twisted into anger over half-hearted drama from a message thread with some now ex-friends. I kicked the frog with quite a substantial portion of my bleak energy, I stepped on it and kicked it into the wall of the house. I just craved any kind of emotion which I so thirstily received. I felt a tiny spark of guilt because I normally adore small insects and animals, I almost even shed a tear, however, the nothing arrived shortly after. So now I lie in my bed at the bottom of my own personal ocean typing a post to strangers, for what? I don't know what's wrong with me. I need help but nobody on the internet is going to fix me and make it all go away. I don't even know what the point of typing this was other than some stupid new level of attention-seeking. Well fuck it all and have a goodnight if you read this far.";"Help me with what?

Response waiting stress relief;Basically I asked a girl out and am waiting for a response, that was a few hours ago, probably not going to get one, still causing stress and having a hard time relaxing. I got that shortness of breath in my chest you usually have right before you have to do something you’re nervous about, (test, speech, etc.) however not having any idea when, what or if I’ll get a response is exemplifying that. Anyone have any ideas for how I can alleviate some of these nerves and help myself relax? (Don’t say alcohol because that will just lead to drunk texts);Response waiting stress relief Basically I asked a girl out and am waiting for a response, that was a few hours ago, probably not going to get one, still causing stress and having a hard time relaxing.

Going through one of the worst periods of my life health wise;I never thought I would come to this point in my life where I would be having heart problems due to stress and anxiety. I haven’t been able to fully sleep this whole week and I’ve been staying up or waking up suddenly too. My heart has been making weird noises and I had to go to urgent care just to make sure things weren’t wrong. On the bright side my ekg was normal and I’m not having any signs of anything serious. But I’m having a hard time resting. I haven’t talked to any of my friends in a while and have just been talking to my coworkers and parents. And I can’t keep talking to my parents.

Sickness + busy job = stressed;I got very sick over the weekend and unfortunately it did not go away on Monday. I took yesterday off and today off because of the sickness. The entire time I have had off I have had a terrible knot in my stomach from stressing about all the things I’ve missed and will need to catch up on. I feel bad for the people who have had to cover me when I know I shouldn’t. I know I am entitled to rest and recovery but I cannot shake the feeling of letting people down. I have a fever so maybe that is making me over emotional and irrational in my thoughts. I guess my time off has been anything but relaxing. I just needed to vent.;Sickness + busy job = stressed I got very sick over the weekend and unfortunately it did not go away on Monday. I took yesterday off and today off because of the sickness.

"Anxiety; depression; ptsd from childhood trauma 30 years later? Any insight appreciated.";"*Backstory** I'd like to tell my story in hopes someone can offer some insight about where to go from here or assurance that I'm not alone. The pandemic hasn't treated any of us well, myself included. I had two non-life-altering events occur about 10 and 7 months back that spun me out with some disproportionately intense anxiety and I started questioning a lot of stuff about my behavior, sanity and even intellectual capability. For years I'd been having intrusive thoughts I kept dismissing as just a bad habit or related to stress. They're mostly self-critical, sometimes slightly paranoid in content. As the pandemic fell upon us these thoughts got WAY intense. I was shushing myself out loud in front of people sometimes because I couldn't think or listen to the radio or anything without them inundating my mind. They've since calmed down a little over the summer, and I'm pretty scared of going back there. I didn't even know they were intrusive thoughts until maybe a month ago. I really thought I might have a mental illness or intellectual disability. I'm still very confused about how I feel. Since I got my vaccine, I've felt comfortable going to the Dr.'s office and brought up what I thought was ""anxiety"". I had a blood test (results fine) and after some screening questions my Dr. asked me if I was depressed. I didn't think so at the time, but my symptoms (primarily early morning awakenings, rumination, the thoughts, and not sadness but a discomfort I can't describe) more closely match depression than anxiety, so I've been given a script for some antidepressants. I don't know that I'm ringing all the bells for depression or anxiety though. **Here's where I need some insight.** I am extraordinarily uncomfortable discussing with my Dr. how I feel. My voice is shaky and I feel like I'm fighting back tears with a queasy feeling in my chest. I was asked at one point if I experienced childhood trauma. While I hadn't considered my childhood traumatic before, I knew it wasn't ideal. Now I'm looking into childhood trauma, and I'm hitting many points on the list I'd been threatened with abandonment, lived a parent who abused alcohol, witnessed domestic violence, and it was frequently a hostile environment (yelling, slamming cabinets and doors and such). Having a child of my own now, I'm questioning other aspects of my upbringing. I'm a grown man, and I've lived with this for 30 years. I feel fucked up that I'm this terrified of how I feel, my intrusive thoughts, and how emotionally volatile it feels to discuss my feelings with a Dr.. I can maybe see how some of my experiences in childhood are effecting my adult behavior. I don't know if pushing it all down again and moving on is a solution. Is this discomfort something that can be corrected? Why is this happening now; the stress of the pandemic; I can't be the only person in their late 30's going bananas and wondering from where this came from, right?

Gained 4kg in the past 4 months.;Hi, I’ve (F17) always been around 45 kg. I never gained much weight. Even when I ate double lunches, I would remain 45 kg. Fast forward a couple months, I’m 49 kg. College apps are nearing and my predicted grades determine my acceptance offers from my UK universities. I’m a very type A personality, and I usually just work harder during times of high pressure/stress. It’s strange that I started gaining weight a while after I stopped eating double lunches. I don’t know what to do. I’m not the type to break down or cry from stress either. I am quite calm and collected, but I do think of what I must achieve and what I must do daily.;Gained 4kg in the past 4 months. Hi, I’ve (F17) always been around 45 kg. I never gained much weight.

Stress is the silent killer. Mental and emotional stress affects every cell in the body.;"The mind can turn the body's pH from acidic to alkaline in a matter of minutes. Stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in your body; the mind can positively or negatively affect DNA. One of the fastest and easiest to feel, method to counteract stress, comes from a natural reaction that our physical body has to us having consistent/strong enough positive thoughts. Whether from positive memories, thanking God, thinking about your future plans, someone you love, inspiring or moving moments in life/movies/songs. Really consider the fact that from just thinking certain positive thoughts your whole physical body can get chills all over it or just in certain locations (for now). If you take time to notice you will find that your self induced positive chills have an accompanying sort of wave underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot). After researching what that specific current underneath the skin is I came across a sort of *energy* we have that is tied to our spirit. I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more. Now consider this if you can truly induce that feel good occurence at will, you can definitely use it to counteract feelings of stress. If you would like to know how to take control of that energy and how to, at will, stop that paralyzing feeling of stress on it's track.

I finally got away from my toxic mother and I regret it;It's only for 2 years (for now) because I had to move away for school and I just regret it. I miss my dad, who I had to leave behind with my mum, I have two roommates I can't seem to get along with, school is hell because I can barely pay attention and have no motivation, it's almost impossible to take care of myself and I'm barely able to deal with all my other responsibilities. If that wasn't enough, I have to deal with my depression and anxiety and it's getting worse by the day. At least that's what it feels like. I can't even get along with others because my social anxiety is so bad, I immediately start to panic as soon as someone tries to talk to me. I also feel like there's nothing to say about me because depression just made me become a zombie. This is hell. I already had little to no will to live when I was home and now it only got worse. I guess life isn't for everyone. I'm really starting to believe, that I wasn't meant to get this far and now everything is trying to get rid of me.;I finally got away from my toxic mother and I regret it It's only for 2 years (for now) because I had to move away for school and I just regret it.

If that wasn't enough, I have to deal with my depression and anxiety and it's getting worse by the day. At least that's what it feels like. I can't even get along with others because my social anxiety is so bad, I immediately start to panic as soon as someone tries to talk to me. I also feel like there's nothing to say about me because depression just made me become a zombie. This is hell. I already had little to no will to live when I was home and now it only got worse. I guess life isn't for everyone. I'm really starting to believe, that I wasn't meant to get this far and now everything is trying to get rid of me.;1;

Working where you are disliked is very stressful;Especially for a large corporation, where there is no real feedback. I have no idea if I'm doing good or bad. I've gotten nothing but positive feedback, but haven't moved and inch, while people with worse feedback have moved up. Your supposed to trust the passive social cues, but my mind isn't well suited for that, as I have psychosis symptoms so I try to practice ignoring things. At will employment means I could be let go any day. If I was I'd have to lie about it to get another job. I need to be more fake enthusiastic/competent.

Exercise for PPD after a c-section that isn't walking?;I have had depression throughout my adult life. I had a baby about 1 week ago and was preemptively diagnosed with PPD during my pregnancy given my mental health history and a fairly rough go of it during pregnancy. I am not sure what to do. I've tried various SSRI/SNRI's but the main side effect for me is excessive drowsiness, obviously not doable right now with a newborn and very little sleep. I'm in therapy, but I've been bouncing around different therapists for the last 6 years and no one has really helped me at all. I think I am in the small subset of people for whom therapy just isn't a good treatment option. Exercise has been the most helpful for me in the past in managing depression but I absolutely cannot go for a walk for exercise. Walking is not intense enough and I end up ruminating and feel worse than ever the more I walk. The last few weeks of pregnancy my mental health was in the garbage after I was going on lots of walks to try to get labor going. I'm really not sure what I can do to get moving after the c-section. I don't even think I could do yoga as it requires too much core work. Walking is just not an option for me with the rumination and intrusive thoughts.

I feel stress every day and apparently it's not normal?;"My whole adult life has been filled with stress, either lots of it before looming deadlines or smaller doses of every day stress like a general sense of worry about money, career, social interactions, time, etc. My partner doesn't experience this; he doesn't worry about something unless it's about to happen, because in his opinion, worrying won't help the situation. He's been down to his last $200 in a foreign country before and managed to find a job before his money ran out, so i guess his lack of stress was justified. He tells me all the time that I shouldn't be stressed so much because there's no point in doing so. On the other hand, I stress about everything because I feel that if I'm not stressing, I won't be prepared for when something unexpected happens. Like if I have a leaking pipe and need to spend thousands fixing the damage. How do you not feel the urgent need to make sure you have enough money to prepare for something like that? What's normal? Is it normal to be stressed every day? Or is it normal to not be stressed unless something big is about to occur? How do I stop worrying about things that are rationally beyond my control when a part of me believes that if I can anticipate it, I'll be prepared for when it happens? Ugh. Now I'm stressing about whether I'm too stressed. Life is stressful. Any ideas on how to stop stressing about every little thing?";"I feel stress every day and apparently it's not normal?

Tomorrow my depression will be one year old. I don't know if I need to celebrate or to complain my self.;I am 18 years old, I am from Mexico and until a few months ago I realized that I could have something upset. At the beginning of August 2019 my life took a pretty good turn, everything was going to improve and it did. my school demanded so much time that I didn't have time for anything I was extremely happy. everything was going well, grades, friends, I was even going to start a relationship with a very special girl, my family had finally found a balance. When the pandemic arrived, I was not so affected, but it all started when my cousin decided to commit suicide on August 31, 2020, without any sign or warning, it was all very sudden. They asked me to give a few words at his funeral but I couldn't, and all those things that I still had to say I kept to myself. All this year I had good times and bad, but little by little everything rotted, my family separated completely, my school closed and that dream of having graduated from that school disappeared. After all, I filled many of my afternoons smoking marijuana and tried to fill in those little holes that I was living. In March it was the last time I saw my mother because of a stupid thing I did and that every day makes me feel guilty. I filled my days with depressing philosophy, I walked away from all my friends, my life really stopped. Sometimes I start to think and I imagine myself with a psychologist talking about my problems, and only realizing that my life is wrong, but what could it be wrong? I do not have any disability or something, some disease that prevents me from being happy. But problems overwhelm me and take my breath away, I am speechless in these situations. Sometimes I start to think what would have happened to me if the whole pandemic hadn't happened. I just wanted to share my story, thanks for reading );Tomorrow my depression will be one year old.

i want to be excited about life again;i had a dream of a time where i was genuinely happy with my life. i saw a lot of people that i cared about and it felt very nostalgic and i felt really happy. then i woke up and realized none of those people are in my life anymore or at least on the same basis as they used to be. i went through today with nobody speaking to me, and now im about to go to bed without accomplishing anything because i felt really depressed. bonus points for not eating anything in 2+ days. don’t really know the point of this post tbh. just felt like i needed it somewhere update thank you all for the love and advice. i feel a little better and motivated and honestly expected this post to get lost in the sub. this community is amazing and i’m really grateful <3 update ate something. nice;i want to be excited about life again i had a dream of a time where i was genuinely happy with my life. i saw a lot of people that i cared about and it felt very nostalgic and i felt really happy. then i woke up and realized none of those people are in my life anymore or at least on the same basis as they used to be. i went through today with nobody speaking to me, and now im about to go to bed without accomplishing anything because i felt really depressed. bonus points for not eating anything in 2+ days. don’t really know the point of this post tbh. just felt like i needed it somewhere update thank you all for the love and advice. i feel a little better and motivated and honestly expected this post to get lost in the sub. this community is amazing and i’m really grateful <3 update ate something. nice;1;
I finally told my parents I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.;"They didn't care at all. I got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and ""what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?"". When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"". I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"". You are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid. EDIT Thank you all for the warm and understanding messages, it made me cry. To those who have parents like mine, I'm so sorry. Thank you so, so much. I woke up to so many messages, and I read every single one. ";"I finally told my parents I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. They didn't care at all.

Over reaction to small trigger;I always had an over-reaction to stress, both general stress and surprise stuff. Surprise jump scare make me the sensaion of a stabing in my heart. Doctor say it's fine But recently it become out of control. I play a videogame, and there is an enemy who spawn by surprise. a very basic monster, like a rat It's strike a panick attack and a stabbing pain in the heart, I need half an hour to calm down.

So stressed about the tiniest things. It’s all building up and I feel like I can’t cope.;Everything is getting me so stressed to the point I literally feel so miserable and depressed I can’t function. Yesterday it was trying to book a train, being yelled at by my boss, my boyfriend replying slowly, and not getting survey responses for a job. I was crying and it al got too much even though they’re only little things. Today I have just woken up and so far my boyfriends birthday present has been delayed by 6 months, my grandma has cancelled lunch with me unless I can think of a different cafe to go to(which I can’t), and two of my friends have cancelled plans with me. Everything feel s like it’s just building up so much I’m supposed to be on holiday relaxing but instead I’m just crying and just want to go back to sleep so I don’t have to deal with everything! My chest feels tight and I don’t have the energy to get up and face my day. Please help if there’s a way of coping better with these little things because I don’t want to feel this rubbish.;So stressed about the tiniest things.

being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.;"before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way. I was wrong. My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school. Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday. My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff. My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me. They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"". I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression. I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto. School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down. I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone. I feel so tired of keeping up the mask. I can't carry on their expectation.

"Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""";This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works) **And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression. Peace out, and much love.;"Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die."" This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class.

Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better;It's really weird. My friends in school have no idea about my depression and I like to keep it that way, so I always try my best to hide it and I smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when I have a second to myself but it's just really weird. Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here. Edit It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days;Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better It's really weird.

Alone;Fuck me, man. I hate that I feel so alone. I’m working 7 days a week, come home to no one and no one reaches out to me to see how I’m doing. In these times I understand everyone is handling it their own way but I’m on the verge, man. I have a therapist and talk to her once a week but after I broke my own heart with my best friend I feel lost. We still talk but I can’t keep doing this. I feel like I’m torturing myself but still feeling the way I do. She’s dating someone else and my dumbass waited last minute to tell her. Last ditch effort I guess. I can’t anymore. I just want to shut the world out and be left alone until I wither away. Ill be talking to my therapist about this today but I need to vent now. Thanks for listening.;Alone Fuck me, man.

Responsibilities reduced to the slightest. And no must and should induced in your life in any way. It feels romantic and so free.

Gamers made me depressed;I know that's a bold statement. I made a similar post on Reddit a while back. But it got deleted after my google account was suspended. Because of that and the fact that a Lot has transpired since then I figured I would repost the story here. As typical of pretty much everyone born since the 80s, I was into games ever since I was little. Got my Wii when I was 6, played Turok with my half-brother on his old gaming device, and poured hours into Minecraft. So as soon as I saw the trailer for Fallout 4 back in 2015 I was almost immediately hooked. I’ve always been a history buff along with being fascinated by dystopias and American nostalgia so Fallout seemed right up my alley. I was even more hyped when I saw a video from a YouTuber I liked at the time that talked about the Fallout universe and the lore behind it. Sadly I was only 11 at the time so it wasn't likely my parents would let me buy it. But I was patient and by 2017 I was finally able to play. Let me say I absolutely loved it. I thought the story was heart-wrenching and I fell in love with all the characters in the game. Over the next year, I went on to play both 3 and new vegas and loved them just as much. Although as time went on I started to realize people had different opinions as me. Which is fine. I want to make it clear right now that I do not have a problem with people disliking things I like. In Fact, there are plenty of other opinions in which I hold that are wildly unpopular online. Hell at first I wasn't even mad they disagreed with me. I just saw us as having a differing opinion and left it at that. But as I spent more time online. It became more and more annoying to see some of these fans talk. They seemed to act as if what they loved was objectively superior and then rub it in my face. This post is a good[ example]( and this[ one]( There are a lot more I could show you but I think you get the picture. Moving along, I was able to tune it all out. Even after Fallout 76 came out. A game that was reviewed so poorly it seemed to vindicate these fanboys. I personally didn't like 76 anyway and figured that most of the hate was independent of the hate for 3 and 4. So I continued to enjoy games as much up until the summer of 2019. But there was one last thing that truly kicked off my depression. There's a Fallout YouTuber called Oxhorn. He seemed like a decent YouTuber and I was even comforted by the fact that he seemed to be a big name in the community and liked Fallout 4. Well, I soon found that after Fallout 76 came out people were out there trying to cancal him. Some of the things people were saying about him let me down but I saw it as an opportunity to see these people for who they really were. People who were willing to smear someone for what they did or didn't like. People also seemed to side with Oxhorn when it came to his response which got a few hundred thousand views so I was at peace. Well, as if the universe wanted to fuck me over. The well-respected YouTuber The Right Opinion made his own video on the matter. One that got over a million views and effectively ruined my life. It seemed that the New Vagas fanboys won in the end. Their ability to smear people if they liked something they didn't. Calling them names while jacking off for the game that was special to them without consideration for what was special to me. Since then things have gotten much worse. Everywhere I look online people praise New Vegas and constantly use it to one-up 4. It's even extended to real life. I talked with a guy recently who claimed I had a bad taste in character and in games for expressing my opinions on New Vegas. Someone else chimed in and said “You do realize new vegas is the most critically acclaimed fallout game right” A message that’s been repeated to me again and again. Yes, I get it. Everyone fucking loves New Vegas. I loved it too. Everyone also hates Fallout 4. And apparently, I have shit taste in storytelling because I loved it as well. I get it. Maybe you're right. Maybe I’m just one big idiot whose opinions are invalid and no one agrees with them. That’s fine. But why do you gotta rub it in my face? Now I can't enjoy games anymore. All the fun just seemed to be sucked out of them. The sad part is I only really got to play four mature games on my own. The three Fallout games I already mentioned and a fourth one called “We Happy Few''. But after all this drama. It was taken away from me. The real Irony is that when I finally got the chance to play a game “The Outer Worlds” that was made by the original creators of Fallout, which these New Vegas fanboys were worshiping as a genius. I was already too depressed to play it It’s not even just Fallout, I can’t play a single game with the excitement and enthusiasm I once did. I guess that’s because of the gaming community in general. The instant fanboyism and hatred for companies that I couldn't give a shit about. I know you’ll probably argue I shouldn't let it get to me. Believe me for the longest time it didn't. But it just became too much. Now I've lost an important part of my life. It’s because of this I've been severely depressed for the past couple of years. Keep in mind this isn't the only reason I'm feeling this way. I don’t have many friends, I feel as if I fail at everything I do, and I’m just feeling like life has no meaning. So ya know typical depression bull shit. It’s just that gaming was a big coping mechanism for much of my life. So to have it stripped away from me as this has really caused me to become apathetic about pretty much everything. It makes me feel Like I can’t go on any longer. I actually went berserk recently and made many Reddit posts telling people they fucked up my life. I know that was Insane. But I didn't know what to do. I felt so alone. I felt like I knew one was listening. I went on to post a video onto youtube saying I was going to, you know, end it all. My dumb ass even had the balls to email Ign and demand them to spread my story. I know It’s crazy. Believe me, I was desperate. I just wanted people to understand how I felt. I know no one does. That’s fine. All I know Is I’m just depressed. You don’t have to understand if ya can’t. I just want people to listen. I know all this sounds dumb. I want to reiterate that this Isn't only just because of games. And Even if it was, they were pretty important to me. A Lot of you guys grew up on games. You must know what it’s like to be my age. It was something that kept me through the day and now it’s gone. I feel like my adolescence has been robbed from me. I was only 15 when I stopped enjoying games. Now I’m 17 and I don’t imagine I’ll have time for them in the future. I’d like to conclude on one note. If any of you ever held any opinions that were different from mine that’s fine. I’ve always respected them and I will continue to respect them. But if you acted cruelly or did everything you could to make me feel this way then congratulations. It’s because of you that my life feels empty. It’s because of you I’ve lost one of my favorite hobbies. I hope you're happy.;Gamers made me depressed I know that's a bold statement.

So ya know typical depression bull shit. It’s just that gaming was a big coping mechanism for much of my life. So to have it stripped away from me as this has really caused me to become apathetic about pretty much everything. It makes me feel Like I can’t go on any longer. I actually went berserk recently and made many Reddit posts telling people they fucked up my life. I know that was Insane. But I didn't know what to do. I felt so alone. I felt like I knew one was listening. I went on to post a video onto youtube saying I was going to, you know, end it all. My dumb ass even had the balls to email Ign and demand them to spread my story. I know It’s crazy. Believe me, I was desperate. I just wanted people to understand how I felt. I know no one does. That’s fine. All I know Is I’m just depressed. You don’t have to understand if ya can’t. I just want people to listen. I know all this sounds dumb. I want to reiterate that this Isn't only just because of games. And Even if it was, they were pretty important to me. A Lot of you guys grew up on games. You must know what it’s like to be my age. It was something that kept me through the day and now it’s gone. I feel like my adolescence has been robbed from me. I was only 15 when I stopped enjoying games. Now I’m 17 and I don’t imagine I’ll have time for them in the future. I’d like to conclude on one note. If any of you ever held any opinions that were different from mine that’s fine. I’ve always respected them and I will continue to respect them. But if you acted cruelly or did everything you could to make me feel this way then congratulations. It’s because of you that my life feels empty. It’s because of you I’ve lost one of my favorite hobbies. I hope you're happy.;1;
There is no space for people like me;Typing this out feels so painful and pointless. There is no space for men like me in this society. Men who don't fit in this society's definition of handsome or beautiful or sexy. It doesn't matter if you are a cheat or an abuser, a 25-30 BMI with a nice looking face is the free pass. By now you have decided put in one of those boxes called incel or something similar. I understand that. I would also have done that too a few years back. God, I don't even have the energy to tell the complete story and you don't have the time either. Long story short, my ex came in to my life 12 years ago to escape a mentally and physically abusive relationship. And WE found happiness. Proper happiness. Among the maddening chaos of med school and utter hopelessness of everything else, we shared laughter and tears. She loved me. I loved her. It isn't easy loving someone in a country we live in. People around us used to consider us constant(at least those 3 or 4 people who are my friends, although she was my only best friend ). I say this again - she was the only person in my 27 something years of my life who was kind to me. We shared each others trauma. She became my entire life and I was her entire life too... at least for 7 years or so. Then she walked away one day. 'It's not you it's me' - out of the blue. We almost got married. Almost. Over the years I have always been proud of our fidelity and loyalty and considered them to be the forte of whatever we had. I guess happy people look beautiful. Women approached me everyday. Mostly because of my career. I never looked sideways. She walked away to be with a friend from her med school in a matter of days. (I heard that he dropped her then girlfriend on a single day notice. He had practice) My entire world collapsed in a matter of moments. I entered my hell. I have been here for the last 4.5 years. No sleep cycle. No one to talk to. No respite. I have literally spent weeks or months in complete solitude. Not even my parents talk to me. When I say talk, I don't mean long conversations. I haven't heard a hello or a good morning or a happy birthday in these years. I stayed entirely mum for weeks at a stretch. I tried to kill myself 3 or 4 times. All I think of is a way to die peacefully. But she kept coming back quite a few times. This new guy supposedly abused her verbally and physically. But she went back because he was a 'poor thing'. Not economically - his parents are filthy rich and he doesn't feel any moral obligation, not to use that money. He is a poor thing because he suffers from liver disease due to excessive drinking and drugs. Did I mention that I am the prude who does not smoke and drinks socially literally TWICE a year on average? Oh and she accused me of emotional abuse and made up things so that she could justify going back to him. I am guilty of letting her repeat this cycle quite a few times. I love her. I can't help it. Only a kind word from her mouth soothes my soul. I had built my world around her bit by bit. I forgot all the childhood trauma, all those bullies, all those unkind words. I forgot I wasn't beautiful. She made me feel beautiful. I worshipped her. I was so thankful to God for finally making me happy. I thought it was our happily ever after. And then I lost everything. I can't face myself in the mirror. People don't approach me like before because they know something is broken. And the rest of them doesn't believe that we separated. So here I am. Typing this fucking thing out. The new loser creep. There is no sympathy for people like me in this society. I have tried to hate her with everything I have. I could not. I cannot. I just hate myself more for not being enough. Now I dream about my death in vivid details. I was the quite nerd in school. She made me come out my cocoon. And now I have nothing to survive. I haven't smiled or laughed in 4 years. I have suffered death of loved ones and more misfortunes. I have been backstabbed by people whom I considered to be close. From a promising academic talent to a useless recluse. I don't think I can be a good doctor anymore. If you read this, thanks for listening. Mental health care is not available where I live.

I feel like my mental health professionals don't care but I can't tell if that's the depression talking;"Hi! I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question. I don't normally like to discuss my mental health problems because I think that makes my problems feel worse, but I need some outside judgement here. I'll keep this as quick as possible, but I'm afraid it's still going to be a little long. I'm in a partially hospitalized mental health program, which means that I go to a hospital 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. I see psychiatrists and therapists there, but I fill my own prescriptions at my local pharmacy. I've been in this program 3 weeks, with \~1 to go. At the beginning of the program, the psychiatrist wanted to adjust the dose of one of my medicines. Instead of just ordering a prescription for pills at the new dose, she decided to order 30 pills which were each about a third of the new dose, so that I could take a little more or less as she thought appropriate. From the beginning, she told me to take 3/day. I took 3/day, so the 30 pills only lasted 10 days. I had to really bug my therapist to get a new appointment with the psychiatrist after that 10 days was up, even though this medicine is one of the ones you can't just stop taking safely. Finally, I got to see her 13 days from when she wrote the original prescription, which was this last Friday. When I went to fill the new prescription at about 4 that afternoon, the pharmacy tech told me that my insurance wouldn't cover the new pills because my psychiatrist had written ""one a day"" on the original prescription. He said he could give me the pills, but I'd have to pay the full sticker price of $780 instead of my nice co pay ($0). I stayed calm because I thought this was just a stupid mistake and called my psychiatrist, who nonchalantly told me that the pharmacy tech was wrong and that I should just be ""more assertive"" about filling the prescription. If that didn't work, she said, I could try Good RX. I tried Good RX, and only got $40 off. I called back, this time panicking a bit, at exactly 4 17 pm. The secretary informed me that the psychiatrist had ""just walked out,"" but offered to refer me to my therapist. My therapist was kind, but said something which boiled down to ""Friday at 4 is almost Friday at 5, and no one here is going to be able to help you on Friday at 5."" I ended up coming back the next day and, with the help of Good RX and the incredibly kind pharmacy tech, getting the pills for $113. I just want to know is the program's response (or lack thereof) normal? Are most mental health professionals this laid back about seemingly urgent stuff or do mine really just not care? I have only had 1 other psychiatrist and she's awesome (I plan on returning to her after this program), so I know she would never do this. The depressed, hopeless voice in the back of my brain is telling me that these people really don't give a fuck and that I should just give up and not return for my last week. Whether or not that is a reasonable conclusion, how can I push myself to go back to the program despite feeling hurt and confused by this? Thanks in advance for your help! Edit I just realized while taking my Abilify that she wrote ""1/2 tablet daily"" on the prescription of 30 tablets. I was only supposed to take 1/2 of a tablet for the first 6 days, after that she told me to take 1 tablet a day. Does this mean my insurance won't cover a refill of the Abilify until 60 days have passed????? This is more rhetorical, because I think I know the answer. I know I'm really lucky in a way because my financial position is safe enough that this isn't a huge issue, but I want to scream at these people. The pharmacy tech said this is basic prescriber knowledge, and I'm pretty certain he wasn't wrong.

My anxiety and professor are going to kill me;Hi, I am from India I don't know what is going to happen next in my life. There is a huge uncertainty that is killing me from inside. Its related to my career and how my college professor is hell bent to take it away from me despite the covid situation around here. I have no one I can turn to for help. Each day i wake up with a high bp and heart rate. My bp and anxiety remains high so much that i can't sleep and remain awake for 10 hrs straight. Finally my heart and brain eventually tire themselves out so much due to excessive pumping and overthinking that i can sleep for an hour and then I wake up and the cycle continues. My professor wants to have a vendetta on me. Despite me facing financial crisis and my teammates experiencing high stress situation after they and their entire family turning out covid positive we tried to implement our project work. However my professor didn't even bother to guide us or even understand the situation we had been through. At age of 22 when i am about to have a good job at a renowned IT company I am facing anxiety attack as my professor has displayed a full fledged threat of failing us and ruining our career. Neither she nor anyone else is ready to listen to my side of the story. No one is here to see my pain. I simply can't live like this. I don't deserve all this. And now I am supposed to fail and repeat and eventually loose my career which hasn't even begun all because of a situation of crisis that wasn't in our control and because of a vengeful professor and her ego.;My anxiety and professor are going to kill me Hi, I am from India I don't know what is going to happen next in my life.

This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like ;"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it. EDIT Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you. ""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on. And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free. But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on. At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point? You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant. By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel. When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape."" EDIT 2 Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in. ""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""";"This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like  When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free. But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on. At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point? You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant. By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel. When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape."" EDIT 2 Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in. ""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""";1;

I need some advice about my GF;Hey guys, I need some advice regarding my gf or rather ex-gf, she broke up with me last night, because the situation was such that we were a couple for about a month, of which the relationship was long distance, so there were four meetings, and I found out from her that she was traumatized by a certain boy, at the time she was 13 and now 18, who simply broke her off mentally, I won't go into details, I don't want to go into details, but our relationship reminded her of that one, so she got scared and decided to break it off.

How do I keep going with this assignment?;So I'm writing my final assignment for uni after 4 years. It's due in 2 days and I have 5000 words left to write. I was diagnosed with Covid just over 2 weeks ago which has left me really behind. I'm still suffering with brain fog and anxiety from covid and I am finding this an impossible task. I'm not someone who quits but I genuinely dont know how I will do this. I cant concentrate at all on the paper and I dont know how I can keep going with it. Not sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just need to have a moment to panic and stress.;How do I keep going with this assignment? So I'm writing my final assignment for uni after 4 years.

I’m going to kill myself over the weekend;"I don’t know why I am writing this, probably just to vent. I’ll take any advice but please don’t ask me to not do it. I know nobody will read this but here it goes; I am 15 and I have attempted suicide multiple times since the age of 7. I have had social anxiety for a few years now and I don’t care how painful death is, it’s better than the torture this is. (Sorry if that sounds cringe) Due to the social anxiety I have no social connections of any type outside of my single mother. I haven’t gone through anything bad in my life, but I don’t think you really need a justification for killing your self other than it is what I have chosen to do. If my social anxiety went away I would want to live to the rest of my life, but it is impossible to get rid of (yes I’ve tried medication and therapy. It’s become really painful seeing my old freinds continue to move on with their lives while I’m here alone with no life. I just can’t handle another day of this and the only way forward is suicide. Again any advice would be appreciated and if you guys recommend anything I haven’t tried yet I will definitely take your advice if it gives me a second chance at living. Edit thank you to everyone for the support, I still can’t bare the thought of going on another week. There just isn’t anything in my life that is worth living for and I’m sorry to disappoint everyone. Again thank you for everyone’s efforts to comfort me and I appreciate it so much, hope everyone has a good week. Update I have been talking to lots of people who reached out, I still don’t really want to go on but I feel like I should try some of the things people suggested.

Too stressed. ;So they say a little stress is good for us. Makes us work well under pressure etc. But I just don't get that kind of stress. For example at work when things get on top of me I tend to just freak out. My job involves a lot of lifting and shifting, so it is also physically demanding. It starts to make me look bad, as when people come to ask me for things I have become very dismissive and this isnt like me. I have had cognitive behavioural therapy (privately) for anxiety/stress/depression and it did work a little. But when I'm at work I can't really use the techniques I was taught. I have started getting headaches. I also used to be on beta blockers for high blood pressure (and im only 21). Any suggestions on how to go forward? I don't want to go see the doctor because I don't want to have any psychological problems on my health records. Looks kind of bad. Sometimes I think about meds, but i've had substance abuse issues in the past so i would rather not go back there. Hope you are all doing well. ) xx;Too stressed.

What the????;Throwaway. Hear me out, please. I feel as if my life will never get better. I just started college after a horrendous high school experience complete with bullying and exclusion. College isn't shaping up to be much better so far despite inspiring words by those around me and personal hopes. I spend my days after class wandering around looking for people to hang out with. I sometimes get a few snapchats for later contacts but they never really turn out to be anything. I feel incredibly lonely and it's going on 5 years of this. I don't know what to do/I don't know if I can do it. It's like God really wants me to eradicate myself. I really want to find myself a group of friends that 110% enjoys me for who I am. I want to find myself a girl that 110% enjoys me for who I am. Getting here to college has intensified a lot of things, not just the loneliness. All of the guys around me are rushing but since I'm trans, I don't feel comfortable doing so. That makes me even more depressed because if I wasn't trans, I would be able to do something like that. I'm at risk of getting the shit kicked out of me for trying to join a frat just because I'm trans. Me being trans also makes things difficult finding a girlfriend. I'm 18 damn years old and have never had anything beyond a platonic hug. Kinda pathetic and I want to change that asap. I'm not ugly, I'm just trans and I don't think many girls in Southern Virginia want a trans dude. I'm really struggling to find a solution to the pain I'm feeling. I've been trying for actual years and I'm reaching the end of my rope. I'm struggling to stay on top of school work and keeping myself healthy. I don't have anything to motivate me to do so. From my point of view, my future is a repeated cycle of what I've already experienced shittiness. I know life is anything but fair but what am I supposed to do? Continue living like this? It just keeps getting harder. I don't want to kill myself because something in the back of my mind says eventually things will get better and I will eventually be married to the love of my life in our farmhouse with our beautiful children but what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I just want to drive and drive until I forget everything but I left my car at my parents' to go to college. I seriously don't know how long it will take to feel okay and I'm tired of testing it.

It was a lonely day without you my friend.; My Short Story It was a lonely day my friend. Everyday is just like this one. Where are you my friend? Are you busy again? Oh ok, we'll talk later then. No I'm not busy, what's up? Today was rough for me too. I'll be here for you whenever you need my support. Anyways its been a while, how have you been lately? I'm glad that you're doing well. I'm so sorry that you guys broke up, what you're feeling definitely isn't easy to deal with. Of course, I'm here to talk whenever you need somebody. Of course I still love you, but not like that anymore. Thank you, but don't you think it's better if we don't talk with such affection like that anymore? After all, we've been apart for4 years now. It's good to hear that you aren't too upset anymore. Did you maybe want to play some video games later or hang out? Oh you're busy? No problem. Just let me know if anything changes. Hey what's going on? Sorry I'm kinda busy right now, but I can talk with you soon if you'd like. I'm sorry that you feel that way right now, but I'll always be free when you need to get something off your chest. Hey, what are you up to today? Did you want to do something with me today? You're busy tonight? No problem, just let me know if plans change. You needed to talk about something? I'm all ears, what's been bothering you? I can definitely understand the pain that you are feeling right now, and I applaud you for your strength. Let me know if I can do anything else for you. It was a lonely day my friend.

How I Learned to Control my Migraines;"Hey guys, I thought I'd share my story of dealing with migraines. I used to start getting them for what I thought was absolutely no reason. I was always an anxious person, but when I started my first job after college, I started getting these stress migraines, and they were debilitating. I would come home from work and just lie down for hours until I fell asleep, only to wake up with the pain the next day. The underlying cause was stress, and I would experience other bodily manifestations of my stress such as bloating, excessive sweating, and sleep issues. As you can imagine, my body was a wreck. While I still experience these feelings from time to time, I have them significantly more under control and rarely get these uncomfortable feelings. Here's how I was able to take care of them. First and foremost, while I did meditate and it did help, I realized the underlying cause was that I wasn't focusing on the task in front of me, and was instead trying to multitask. When you try and multitask, you cause anxiety. Anxiety is ""being here but wanting to be there."" This would take a toll on my mental energy. Once I stopped trying to multitask and focus only on the task at hand, my migraines started to become less frequent. Meditation helps with this because you are asked to practice concentration. Next, when I experienced these feelings, I approached them with a sense of curiosity. Why was my body reacting this way? Instead of getting upset at our body, like most of us do when we get these feelings, I started listening to my body. I realized that stress and anxiety are trying to tell me something. These emotions are my ally as opposed to my enemy. I came up with a great analogy as to why I was getting these migraines. When you consistently put unhealthy food inside your body, what happens? You get a stomach ache. When you consistently put unhealthy thoughts inside your mind, you get a mind-ache, or a migraine! Once I came up with that analogy, I was more mindful of what thoughts I was letting inside of my mind. You'll be surprised with the kind of garbage you let inside of your mind. That's what these feelings are telling you, so becoming curious about them really helped. By this point, I was experiencing the physical manifestations of stress a lot less frequently, but I was still experiencing them. This brings me to my final point. Trust and believe in the process. These won't disappear overnight. However, if you noticed changed up until now (which I did), I trusted the process, and eventually, I almost virtually eliminated them. I hope that helps those of you who are suffering from stress-related migraines. I tried to keep this as short and digestible as possible, so I left out a lot of detail. But please comment or PM me if you want me to expand on anything further. I know how much these suck, so I'm happy to help out further if I can.";"How I Learned to Control my Migraines Hey guys, I thought I'd share my story of dealing with migraines.

My life partner got to be a host for PBS and I'm just so ecstatic;My life partner is awesome, she is a performing artist, she is a disability advocate, and she is honestly just the most interesting and engaging person I've ever met, but I suppose I'm biased. Anyways, it's hard out here making a name for oneself, but she wrangled an opportunity to be a host for a PBS pilot and it just came out today and it is just so wonderful to see her succeeding despite all the consternation, opposition, anxiety and doubt that she works through to do this kinda shit. She's worked so hard and come so far but I think this is one of the first times her successes actually broke through all that and hit her in the face, like this is her *job* to be an awesome person and there's just no better validation than that.

I ruined my own life;It’s no ones fault but my own. I pushed people away and now I have no friends, I don’t even know how to socialize anymore. I’m too anxious to even try and make friends. But at the same time I don’t want any friends. I like being a loner. But I know that I’m never gonna be happy because there’s no one to love me and I certainly don’t love myself. I don’t even know where it went wrong years back, but I wish I could beat the fuck out of my younger self for socially withdrawing myself because I’ll never recover.;I ruined my own life It’s no ones fault but my own.

Stress is causing pain, which is making stress worse. What to do?;Hi! I discovered not too long ago that when I'm really stressed out, I get pains in my abdomen. I know that it's stress and not something more sinister because the first two times it happened, I was extremely stressed, and I went to my doctor, who could find nothing wrong with me, physically. The pain in my abdomen, while I know is not harmful, still freaks me out. It occurs on the right side, and is often low, which of course makes me jump right to appendicitis. Then I start hyper focusing on that and stressing myself out more, which in turn makes the pain worse, it's a pretty vicious cycle. I am currently on medication for GAD, but it doesn't seem to be doing much to help. I have a doctors appointment in a week and a half and plan on speaking to her about maybe switching medications, but is there anything that I can do to manage my stress until then? While it does subside on its own, it's still quite miserable and kind of scary. Thanks!;Stress is causing pain, which is making stress worse. What to do? Hi!

Help coping with extreme, long term stress? I'm going crazy;Hi, I'm 18, and I've been non stop stressed since mid-March. It started during spring break, when all of my roommates went home except for me. I'm really bad at being alone. It made me so anxious and stressed that I got the flu and a severe UTI, as well as abdominal pain. Later, because I was stressed about the UTI, I got really bad chest pain. Then, I started my first major curriculum class, which stressed me out because the teacher was tough and I was the only freshman. Then we had to choose housing and there wasn't enough housing for every student (good job, school), so that had me freaking out pretty horribly. Then, it was time to move out of the freshman dorms, which was a bit overwhelming. In May, my dad told me that he was selling his house, and he wasn't very nice about it. I'm really emotionally attached to that house, so that's stressing me out a lot too. The thought of leaving it makes me want to just lay down on the floor and cry (in fact, I have done so), and he's not being sympathetic at all (as in, when I get sad about it he tells me to grow the hell up). So that's a *constant* stresser. THEN, my dad and my aunt got in a massive fight, and my dad pulled out of helping me buy my plane ticket to visit her in LA. My friends had already gotten their tickets, and I had to find a way to get mine on my own (my place of work closed in January, and I need so much time off this summer that nobody in their right mind would hire me). All the while, I was caught right in the middle of their insane argument. I got really close to cancelling the trip. That was the catalyst for my current predicament, I think. I am currently sick, and I have been for two weeks. I feel horrible all of the time, and get nauseous and dizzy after eating. My heartbeat skyrockets, and I get really shaky too. I saw my GP, and after a physical examination, she chalked it up to all of the stress coming down pretty hard on me. I can't keep letting this stress rule over me like this. It's literally making me sick. What are some ways that I can go about coping with it and keeping it from kicking me to the ground like this? I've gotta do something. I am on medication, but since it's a new prescription, it's going to be a month or so before I see any real improvement.;Help coping with extreme, long term stress?

I will never understand how people can live and be happy;Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me.

Demotivating Stress?;When I get stressed out, I have a tendency to procrastinate and shut down. The more that I have to do the more my mind refuses to do it. School is pretty much my only stressor and, while it doesn’t happen much, when I do get stressed out, I get really stressed out. I’m trying to find some sort of motivation or way out of this habit (mindset? I don’t really know what to call it) because I feel like it’s happening more and more. I have two big projects due soon and it’s really starting to get to me, even though they shouldn’t be that hard. Instead of doing the work, I find myself thinking about it, getting stressed out, and deciding to do something to destress. When I do sit down to do the work, I’m really unproductive and struggle to focus, even when there’s nothing to distract me. It’s just that the more effort I put into the project (or even think about it) the less I enjoy it. What can I do to avoid this and work through it?;Demotivating Stress?

Instead of doing the work, I find myself thinking about it, getting stressed out, and deciding to do something to destress. When I do sit down to do the work, I’m really unproductive and struggle to focus, even when there’s nothing to distract me. It’s just that the more effort I put into the project (or even think about it) the less I enjoy it. What can I do to avoid this and work through it?;1;
Sleeping because you no longer want to be awake;"I'm sure some of you have felt this way. I'm at work. I'm fulfilling my obligations. Once I go home, I'm going to take some over-the-counter sleep meds, brush my teeth, wash my face, make sure my cat has food and water and then try to sleep until I have to work tomorrow. I don't feel like I'm harming myself, nor do I have any real desire to kill myself; I simply don't want to be around for a certain amount of time.

how to overcome ptsd in a new relationship?;"straight to the point, when i was 16 i was in a toxic relationship where my ex boyfriend, 22 at the time, attempted to manipulate me into refraining from speaking to my male best friends and i almost lost them in the process trying to fulfill his desires being the people pleaser i am. this, among other toxic shit, resulted in trauma. my current boyfriend is completely different. he's a sweetheart, but sometimes my male best friends' behaviors tick him off. usually it isn't anything major; just stuff that my boyfriend finds annoying like overly friendly physical contact and whatnot. he would point that out and i, out of fear of repeating the traumatizing past i had with my ex, would go on to defend/justify their actions in a way it seems like i'm attacking him or forcing my opinions and friendships down his throat. it had become a reoccurring problem of me continuously defending my friends and unintentionally putting them above my relationship in fear that i might lose them again and end up alone in case we ever break up. sometimes my boyfriend would lose his temper during those arguments, after having them for more than one or two times, and that resulted in more fear on my part. i know he's not trying to do the same shit my ex tried to pull off, but it's not something i can easily control. yesterday he told me that he's starting to feel like i don't prioritize him in the relationship. he said he feels like a second option, if anything at all, and this contributed in his depression. he doesn't think it's gonna work out anytime soon in terms of this specific topic. how should i deal with it and what is your advice to overcome the ptsd i have from my past experience with a toxic relationship?";"how to overcome ptsd in a new relationship? straight to the point, when i was 16 i was in a toxic relationship where my ex boyfriend, 22 at the time, attempted to manipulate me into refraining from speaking to my male best friends and i almost lost them in the process trying to fulfill his desires being the people pleaser i am. this, among other toxic shit, resulted in trauma. my current boyfriend is completely different. he's a sweetheart, but sometimes my male best friends' behaviors tick him off. usually it isn't anything major; just stuff that my boyfriend finds annoying like overly friendly physical contact and whatnot. he would point that out and i, out of fear of repeating the traumatizing past i had with my ex, would go on to defend/justify their actions in a way it seems like i'm attacking him or forcing my opinions and friendships down his throat. it had become a reoccurring problem of me continuously defending my friends and unintentionally putting them above my relationship in fear that i might lose them again and end up alone in case we ever break up. sometimes my boyfriend would lose his temper during those arguments, after having them for more than one or two times, and that resulted in more fear on my part. i know he's not trying to do the same shit my ex tried to pull off, but it's not something i can easily control. yesterday he told me that he's starting to feel like i don't prioritize him in the relationship. he said he feels like a second option, if anything at all, and this contributed in his depression. he doesn't think it's gonna work out anytime soon in terms of this specific topic. how should i deal with it and what is your advice to overcome the ptsd i have from my past experience with a toxic relationship?";1;
Compliments;"I usually have a hard time taking compliments. I've never been good at it and I'm pretty modest for the most part. I have been dating someone for about 5 years and their mom gave me a compliment today that made me cry. It wasn't about how I looked but who I am as a person. She said "" you have such a calming presence"" I was shocked. I don't receive many compliments other than from my partner and this one just felt so genuine. She said that she is so happy that I'm dating her child and no matter what happens i will always be apart of their family. My family life isn't great so it was a double whammy for me. I've never had someone be happy just for me existing and being myself. She also acknowledged how hard I work in college and not letting anything stop me. I was speechless to be honest.

Could my husband be depressed? How could I help?;Long story short. We have been together for 15+ years. His family is pure academics. Both parents and siblings are phds and postdocs from prestigious schools. I later learned that his mom had been suffering from depression very early on and had been taking medication for a long time. His sister is also depressed to a point that she could not go to class and do home work. His mom had to fly to her school to watch her. She is still taking medication. My husband on the other hand is also a little “crazy”. He always have very unrealistic ideas. And it was ALL TALKS! No action of any sorts. I am really tired of just being the listener and know it’s pure talk. I am a little angry right now because we just had an argument. I am pregnant in my third trimester and he was keep saying the house we live in is shit the weather is too hot. The whole place is shit. He had no friends and no jobs. The world is collapsing and he wanted to abandon me to live in a mountain by the lake in Chattanooga. He just stopped taking coffee and it could be just his withdrawal symptoms. That is another thing. His mom, his sister and himself were all extremely addicted to alcohol and caffeine. They all tried other drugs in schools but I don’t think they are taking them anymore. We always have arguments whenever he is drinking too much or having withdrawals. I wish I could just deal with it once and not all the time. This emotion ups and downs. I wish he could go to a therapist and get tested but he is too proud to do it. He says I am the one that has mental problems.

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...";"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions. So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus. The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software. The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU. Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is. It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one. Edit Thanks so much for the positive response guys.

unsure how to help more;"I personally have been dealing with depression and a few other things for quite a few years. However, im still at a loss on how to help my suicidal sister and im looking for advice. My depression has never got to the point of suicidal thoughts so im unsure how to really help.

I am the only family member she will tell also. Almost every time I see her when i'm back home, she tells me that she wants to kill herself and it used to be even more often to the point where i couldn't focus on school anymore. She also asks me for suicide methods and basically asks me for advice on how to kill herself. I usually try to sit down and listen to her vent about why shes feeling that way but i feel like it never helps. I have also recommended the suicide hotline as another form of help bc i didnt know what to do. Me and my other sister have had to get her checked into a psych ward a few times when she started making a suicide plan (last time it happened was last week). She lives with a really toxic mother (not my mom) and also has a lot of trauma from our dad. I have tried to help her make a plan to get out of that living situation but she doesnt try to. She also barely tells her therapist whats going on and wants to quit. I am unsure what else I can do. And to be honest, I am getting very drained having to be told that she is going to kill herself every time she leaves my house. I also have things im dealing with. This has been going on for years to the point where I avoid talking to her because Im afraid she will tell me shes going to kill herself again.

We never declared that we’re best friends, we don’t text each other every day but no matter what, whenever any one of us feel like shit and depressed and so tired of people, we know we can always reach out to each other. And because of that, I’m so grateful to have you in my life. And i want nothing but the best for you in this life. Thank you for being such a wonderful friend to me! Iloveyou!!;0;
Give everyone your all, receive none in return. Even if it’s a matter of life or death.;It’s times like these where I realize that no matter how hard I try, I’m worth nothing to these people. God forbid I talk about depression or my struggles with diabetes. I’ve insulted them and their ancestors as well as every God known to man. I hate my self for wanting validation from them. I hate myself for trying to be the bigger better person. I just hate my self. I recently got diagnosed with diabetes, we’re still figuring out the proper dosage for me. It’s super tricky, not enough meds and my blood sugar is always high. Enough meds, my blood sugar crashes hard. When I first got diagnosed my sister threw a fit about how it was basically my fault I got diabetes. Mind you, I’m a dentist, other sister is a dentist, other sister (her bestie) is a physician. She has plenty of medical knowledge. Three hours ago, she called me while I was trying to sleep. I didn’t pick up. She texted me on every platform you can think of. When I answered, she told me she was worried because her BF is “tired” and she doesn’t know why. I told her a number of things and when she asked for details, I told her to freaking google it. She said I was being insensitive. 5 minutes later, I apologized twice and went into detail. 15 minutes later, I hear her going up the stairs to her bedroom. 5 minutes after that I feel “unease”. Check my blood sugar, so low I freaked out thinking I might die there. Not that it would be a horrible thing but if I do go, I want it to end in peace with no drama. I barely get downstairs because I want to make a sugary oatmeal dish and call her to ask for help because at that point I couldn’t see. She threw a fit about me waking her up. She knows how life threatening extreme blood sugar readings can be. I just simply don’t matter.;Give everyone your all, receive none in return. Even if it’s a matter of life or death.

Just needing a place to vent;My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass. Our family members don’t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards. I just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can’t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn’t. Anyway, if you’ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling. Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you. ;Just needing a place to vent My 2017 was just a pile of crap.

Money and corona stress;Ok now I can’t legally get a job because of my age but the only person in my family who has a job is my dad remember that.

What emergency stress relief strategies/remedies do you use?;"I had my first attempt at a driving test last week.

Stress is starting to overcome my life. Help?;I have always been stressed. When I was in my teenage years, I had migraines everyday. Medically unexplained. For years. Turns out it was just my body's way of coping with stress. I have been better at handling said stress with the years. I am now doing pretty good at handling myself with a normal level of stress. However, I am still handling stress badly when it is a new amount of stress (for example here, new job, bought an apartment w/ my boyfriend but things are not so good between us, having to move to a new place, a friend living on my couch for some time...) It is tiring for me to be under stress like that. It makes me cry randomly, have bad headaches and lash out a lot. I don't want to, but it seems like my stress needs to escape my body in any possible way. I am comfortable around my boyfriend, so it happens a lot that I am losing it around him because it feels like a safe environment. It is however making my relationship more difficult than it should be, to the point where he says he is really considering ending it.

Have you ever felt anxiety taking over your stomach?;"I did untill I sat down and put all my attention on that area affected by my anxiety and started to slowly consciously guide my breath there.

I felt that area, which was hot from anxiety, become cold and colder as the ""stuck"" energy was being dispelled and after a while it felt as if I swallowed an ice cube which reached the depth of my stomach to that location. To me this says a lot about how important it is to consciously breathe at specific times. For example did you know that certain diseases thrive in an oxygen less body? The most interesting thing about breathing I learned is that it is one of the many expressions from what many would call prana (chi, life-force, prana, qi, ki, pitī, rapture, chills, spiritual chillls, goosebumps, ecstasy, euphoria, aura, mana, ruah, nephesch and many more).

After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself );"I've been struggling with depression for about three months now.

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied.

struggling recently;"I'm using this subreddit as kind of a way to vent because I feel awful for telling my girlfriend these things almost everyday for the past few weeks. Life has been kind of sucky lately, and it is almost entirely because of me. I feel like my (m) relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart because of my stress (hence my posting here), insecurities, paranoia, and anxiety. I saw her over break on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as well as a few times when I have visited at work. But we haven't been able to hang out, by ourselves, to just talk face to face (partly because she is busy and partly because of her parents). For context, we usually hung out many days a week before and after school. I, however, have convinced myself she does not want to see me, and is therefore avoiding me. I think that she just doesn't really like me much anymore, which sucks, because AFAIK she does, and she tells me she does, but I tell myself otherwise. I have convinced myself she likes someone else, or likes something in a guy that I don't have. I feel bad for talking to her about my thoughts and feelings because I feel like I am burdening her with them. I feel like she views me as weak, unattractive, and all the other bad things. I am beginning to think she just wants to leave, but just isn't. I have convinced myself of these things, despite having ZERO evidence to support it, other than the things I misconstrue and misinterpret as evidence.

I hypothesize sometimes about social media's impact on my thoughts, almost everywhere I turn on Reddit, Twitter, or Instagram I see a meme, tweet, or advice post about a cheating, lying, or otherwise shitty spouse/SO, and so I seem to have misrepresented the whole of relationships because of the part that I see online. I don't know. Thanks for reading my long and boring rant. tl;dr - life sucks because I feel bad, sad, and I worry a lot. feel like my relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart. trying to do better, but don't know how to.";"struggling recently I'm using this subreddit as kind of a way to vent because I feel awful for telling my girlfriend these things almost everyday for the past few weeks. Life has been kind of sucky lately, and it is almost entirely because of me. I feel like my (m) relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart because of my stress (hence my posting here), insecurities, paranoia, and anxiety. I saw her over break on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as well as a few times when I have visited at work. But we haven't been able to hang out, by ourselves, to just talk face to face (partly because she is busy and partly because of her parents). For context, we usually hung out many days a week before and after school. I, however, have convinced myself she does not want to see me, and is therefore avoiding me. I think that she just doesn't really like me much anymore, which sucks, because AFAIK she does, and she tells me she does, but I tell myself otherwise. I have convinced myself she likes someone else, or likes something in a guy that I don't have. I feel bad for talking to her about my thoughts and feelings because I feel like I am burdening her with them. I feel like she views me as weak, unattractive, and all the other bad things.

I don't care about anything anymore;About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal? I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education. I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive? My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless.

Does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time?;Lately I’ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that I’m not really interested in doing anything.

Scared about my future;I’m in the final year of my degree. This is generally the time I need to start searching and applying for jobs.

I made a list of what I think are my shortcomings but for some reason I’m not able to get mauled to start working on my skills Meanwhile most of my friends have already found jobs. People with lesser gpa than me have found jobs. I feel left behind and I think I’m spending more time obsessing about what I don’t have and what others have instead of what I can do. My mental health is so badly affected by this. I was laughing in the afternoon but turned to nervous wreck almost an hour after.

I have a lot of things going on at the same time and it’s making me stressed to the point I feel sick.;I’m hoping that somehow me typing all this out will help me overcome everything and make me feel better. I started a new job in the beginning of November. Everything was going good until Thanksgiving. My fiancée and I made the decision we would visit family that day. In hindsight, that was stupid. The day after, my sister started feeling sick and tested positive for COVID, and then her family was getting sick and the ones that got tested were positive. My work told me I had to quarantine, but since I was new, they wouldn’t give me paid leave. That left we with 2 weeks of not getting any money. Thankfully, I had some savings to help scrape by on bills, but I had to go through all of that. Since then, I’ve been struggling and the end of the month bill marathon has been cutting it too close. Had a lot of unexpected expenses. We’ve been living in a 1 bedroom apartment and we are wanting to move into a house because we have no room for anything. Had to store a lot of belongings in our cars. We are also planning a wedding for the end of October. I’m trying to go back to school so I don’t have to work a 3rd shift factory job for the rest of my life. She’s been dealing with PTSD for a few years and has had an uptick in panic attacks the past few weeks. It’s become too much for me to handle. Been dealing with suicidal thoughts.

Can stress affect memory and focus?;This is probably a dumb question, but I feel so dumb recently. I was the best in my grade at science, maths and extension science last year but now I'm in year 11. I make so many dumb mistakes. I did a formative, missing 5 of 27 marks on the dumbest of things. Most of the time about half of my work is wrong because of dumb mistakes. My memory is also worse, from the point that I could remember most things without studying them, now I forget how to do it within days without study. This leads to more stress because I think I'm getting dumber and there might be something wrong with my brain (thanks health anxiety). I've been more stressed recently and was also more than usual stressed last year when it began. Is it common for these sorts of things to happen with stress? ;Can stress affect memory and focus?

I’m tired of being this stressed;My dad and I have always had the best relationship. some days he felt more as freind, but allways knew when to turn “dad mode” on. Iv allways respected him for that. I’m 16 now and about two years ago my dad sad diagnosed with Primary-progressive Multiple sclerosis or PP MS. It’s a rareist form of a rare deaise with no cure. It works by attacking your nerves and slowly over time will paralyze you. Well that’s what most people get, some loose sight,hearing,taste,ability to swallow or talk, and all felling. Less then ten percent get that bad but considering that my dad is at the point most people get at in 20 years done in 2 hes probably going to get that bad. Well he would have if he did’t make a decision. I support what he’s going to do just because I don’t want him in That personal hell. He is going to kill him self before he gets that bad…. I live with him so I can see him getting worse by the day and I’m scared that day might be getting close. I am the only one living with him in fact. I’m staying till his end because there’s no one else who is willing to help so even if I wanted to leave I can’t. He’s lucky I love him so much or I would be ubset over this. I’m more so ubset that no one else really even wants to help. Leaving a 16 year old to take care of his father. Helping him up, cleaning cooking, hell Iv gotten used to wipeing him.

I could get shot and not care,I could be tortured and not care the worst can happen and I wouldn't care. thats how its been but lately its been getting more serious, to the point where I dont care what happens to others , I dont feel like talking about that tho. even when I talk about myself it feels made up like its not real, I know I have derealization but theres something else too,im just moving with no thoughts I can't even feel my movement, I have no reaction to things or facial expressions, I barely noticed as well. my memory is horrible, im merging days and forgetting things that someone told me a second ago,I dont remember if I ate or if I slept, I can't remember the month or my identity sometimes like simple questions.

Happiness really is a privilege;Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don’t say this in spite. If you are happy, that’s amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don’t realize how lucky they are to be happy.

I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast.

Can’t handle littlest of stress;I can’t handle when things don’t go just right. I fly off the handle mentally and just cannot relax. So hard to relax. How do I teach my brain that sometimes in life things just don’t go your way. I know this is fact but can’t seem to accept it.

I learned of a kitchen life hack, tried it, and it really seems to be working!!!;So usually after a week of buying potatoes, they start to sprout even though I have them in what is a dark cool place. And I would remove the sprouts only for the sprouts to come back again two days later. I looked online and apparently if you put apples in the same place as potatoes, it helps keep them from sprouting. Onions actually have the opposite effect and makes potatoes sprout faster. I tried it. I had two Fuji apples that I put in with a dozen potatoes, and I haven't seen a single sprout so far.;I learned of a kitchen life hack, tried it, and it really seems to be working!!!

Some people are just never depressed;I remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he doesn’t think he’s ever really been depressed before. Hearing him say that completely blew my mind because my life has been the exact opposite for as long as I can remember and if I had the same kind of experience as him, I’d be in such a better place right now. I used to think people like that would crumble the moment something really bad happens to them but in all honesty, it seems to be a strength rather than a weakness. His dog who he really loved recently died and he was sad for maybe a week or two but then just bounced right back from it like nothing even happened. Can’t imagine what that must be like. I’m happy for him since I’d hate to see him have to suffer through that but also admittedly envious. Guess some people are just lucky enough to never have to experience this kind of daily hell that never really goes away.;Some people are just never depressed I remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he doesn’t think he’s ever really been depressed before.

Why do people crave to be an adult?;I’m freshly out of Highschool, only 4 months graduate but life already feels like a slog. Wake up, go to a job I hate, repeat 5 days a week, 2 days of free time, do that shit until I retire or die. Why don’t I just b-line it to the end of it? I mean who’s going to care in the end. In the spec of it all my family and girlfriend will move on after a bit. My work sure as hell won’t miss me, only the fucking work I left behind uncompleted is what they’ll miss.;Why do people crave to be an adult?

I’ve been getting headaches and nausea for over 3 weeks now. How do I relieve this stress?;Hi. I’m going into my junior year of high school and I have a lot of summer work to get out of the way. I told myself in early June that I would get all of it out of the way before the school year even ended. The first day is on September 5th and I just got started. At first, I lacked the motivation to get the work done because I was so comfortable with my leisurely summer routine. Now I’m absolutely desperate to get it out of the way. From mid July to now, I’ve been getting raging headaches and nausea. (While I haven’t actually gotten sick yet, I feel like I’m about to) I keep myself up at night just planning my agenda to get my stuff done, only for me to decide not to and stress about it. When I would complete my work I would feel slightly better, only for the headache and nausea to come back a day later. Even when I’m not thinking about my pile of work I still feel like garbage. I still have 3 two page essays to write and one more book to finish and I’m leaving for vacation this Friday. I want to get this work done beforehand and hopefully not have these symptoms while I’m away from home.

It doesn't matter if I'm interested or not, if you're happy, I'm happy;"I wanted to post this somewhere, and i figured this subreddit was the best place. I apologize for any weird formatting, I'm on my phone. . So, I have this best friend, ""J"", and he plays video games all the time. Several hundreds of Steam hours spent playing everything from fps games to strategy/survival games and the like. About a year and a half ago, he invited me to his discord server so I could hang out and meet his other friends. I would join to talk or play a few games with him an his friends, but for the most part J would stream whatever game he was currently playing for me to watch while i just hung out and talked to him. Now, I enjoy watching him play, I really do. It's pretty entertaining most times. But sometimes he plays games that just aren't as interesting for me to watch. But have I ever told him that? No. Why? Because I love hearing him talk. He gets excited about this game and will narrate his actions as he plays. He will start talking nonstop, either to me or just to himself, and gets more animated as the night goes on. Half of the time I understand it, but the other half I'm completely lost. It's very confusing and because of that I don't get as immersed. But the reason I keep asking him to stream his game for me, is because I love listening to him talk about it. I don't think he knows how much I love to listen to him. If he's passionate about it, then I'm more than happy to listen to him talk for hours, and enjoy how happy he sounds.";"It doesn't matter if I'm interested or not, if you're happy, I'm happy I wanted to post this somewhere, and i figured this subreddit was the best place.

Any advice for dealing with debilitating neck tension?;Hey y’all. I (29M) have been struggling for the last few months with pretty severe neck tension caused from a combination of decades of stress and poor posture. The tension has been so bad, that it’s been shooting nerve pain to my hand, and there was even a brief week long period where I couldn’t move my neck much at all. The only thing that seems to help now is e-stim, and that has only lasted for so long. I can’t really get much restful sleep without constantly tossing and turning at night. I’m writing this completely exhausted, in fact. Other than muscle relaxers, does anyone have any ideas or suggestions as to possible solutions? I’m honestly desperate.;Any advice for dealing with debilitating neck tension? Hey y’all.

I cried for 40 minutes after someone very close to me told me they were proud of me;My dad passed away when I was 5 years old. Since then, I've lived my life along side my strong, amazing, beautiful, caring mom and my little sister. She served as my boulder in hard time, while she was herself going through a decade long grief. She kept a stoic face for her children when she was hurting inside, working hard in order to give us the best future and the best opportunities as well as a comfortable lifestyle. My dad had a best friend, my uncle (also my godfather). My uncle has children, and when he was still alive, we participate din everyone of his family event where I would hang out with my (non biological) 'cousins' all the time. My dad was a big family man and I consider my uncle to be my second father. Growing up, I didn't think that having a dad was a big deal. I had lived my whole life (almost) without one, and in my head, I think that my mom serves as both my father and mother figure. But there were times where I would think about my dad, be sad, and wish that I was a daddy's little girl, had a protective father, a dad on whom I could lean on whenever etc... When I watched Disney's The Good Dinosaur or the Lion King I would break down crying because I could truly relate to the story on a deeper level. Today, my uncle gave me 200 euros and told me he was extremely proud of me as he hugged me. He said it was a present for my hard work throughout the years and for my BAC (a big test 12 graders take in France). I was not expecting this at all. I was happy that my second dad, told me that. And it felt like my own dad was telling me this through him. I felt really emotional. I was extremely happy, and grateful. I'm still crying writing this and people might not read this but I want to remember this moment forever.

Bucket list item - started the 9dollarclub!;We started a nonprofit organization called the 9dollarclub. The concept is simple... all of our club members contribute $9 a month. That’s it. No guilt trip fundraisers... no chasing down “big whale” donors... everyone just throws in 9 bucks. Each month we pool the money together and go out and find awesome organizations and people to share it with. We have made 3 “gives” and it makes all of us incredibly happy to know we can all make an impact! So far we have bought new uniforms and equipment for a youth soccer club in Ghana, purchased water filtration systems that will last for 10 years for families in Haiti and sponsored the training of a new dog therapy team in Florida. This is best! Check it out if you care to learn more and join us. 9dc.org.;Bucket list item - started the 9dollarclub! We started a nonprofit organization called the 9dollarclub.

I feel lost;Anybody ever feel anxious or depressed at times but not really sure what the main reason is?

I talked to him on the phone for the first time today and just completely shut down. i didnt know what to do and i genuinely feel like im just making his life harder even though he claims i am not. I am majorly depressed and only partially medicated. I feel like such a burden to him and tell him that he should leave me. He tells me he doesnt want that unless that is what is better for me and he is sorry for me feeling this way. i don’t know how to get through this because I love him so much but i cant even talk to him on the phone rn because of the overwhelming pain it brings me. meanwhile he is having a fun time in college, which i am glad about but our moods are just so opposite at the moment. Hes super happy and glad to talk to me and i just feel like sobbing. I don’t know what to do. He says take it day by day but how are we supposed to do that if i can’t handle talking to him over the phone. I feel like i am causing a rift between us bc i am not able to stop saying harmful things, but it is what is all going on in my head. I also feel like I caused this long distance relationship because my grades weren’t good enough this year to go back in person. I know he cares about me so much but when do i become someone he hates because of the way my brain acts. I am so lonely. (side note I am also in college but not in person).;I don’t know what to do So my bf and i went long distance a couple days ago. we have done it before and were fine but we lived 10 minutes away for 6 months and now he is in college and has a whole world of his own.

After dropping out of school 10 years ago my husband finally graduated high school!;When my husband was a Jr. in high school his mom got cancer, one thing lead to another and he ended up dropping out before the end of his Sr. year. He has always worked warehouse jobs (or the like) to make ends meet for us, but not having his diploma has always made him feel less than. After a really hard year (2020) he decided to do something for himself and finish his high school education! It took him several months but as of this evening he is completely finished with his online high school education program. He should get his diploma in the mail soon. And he is planning on enrolling in college come January. I’ve never been so proud of anyone in my whole life. He’s trying so hard to raise our station in life, and I know this is just the beginning of his achievements. He doesn’t want to post anything on our personal social media until he has the diploma in his hands but I just had to tell someone!!;After dropping out of school 10 years ago my husband finally graduated high school!

I hung out with friends for my birthday after years of spending birthdays alone.;The last few years for my birthday i spent just home alone disappointed that my special day was just generally boring and lonely, but this year was different. I made some great friends at my work and they actually asked the day off to spend the day with me for my 18th birthday. I went out and got my septum pierced and went thrifting and to the mall and out to dinner and im just so greatful. The best part of my day was just that i got to spend it with people that i care about and im so glad that i finally have some real friends. Today feels like the best birthday ive had since i was little and Im just so hapoy and so greatful.;I hung out with friends for my birthday after years of spending birthdays alone.

I get physically sick/stressed when looking at student loan debt.;I am currently in graduate school but not full time so my loans are about to be in repayment in about 2 months. 18 year old me got screwed over by discover. Interest rate of close to 14%. Over the 6 years since I started the loans there I owe close to 120k. I cannot refinance because I make less than 12k a year. I cannot make payments because that 12k doesn't even cover my medical, food, and bill expenses. I know because I'm poor they will reduce the payment to 50$ a month but that will do nothing to bring the ammount down. Everytime I log into my account I litterally get nauseous and my stomach clamps up and occasionally I cry. I don't know how to handle that stress. It looms over me and is impacting my life terribly. I can't move out which is really messing with me, I am engaged but my fiance is paying and trying to do everything as low cost is stressful (don't want to elope I know that's selfish but I want a wedding), I am putting off health problems which are adding up because the cost is too high, cannot get a service dog because the cost is too high, I really want a child and I also get super sad because realistically I will have to wait about 6-7 more years.;I get physically sick/stressed when looking at student loan debt.

Are chronic headaches possible because of stress?;I've been struggling with chronic headaches since I was 14, I'm 18 now.

Slow suicide;Honestly, I don’t see how therapy could even help me at this point. I am currently starving myself because I hate my appearance, especially my chubby face. I assume I’m suffering from bdd..but it doesn’t matter because I don’t want to get treatment anyway. I don’t agree with the notion that I deserve a happy life.Not only that but I would have to once again..like with most things in my life, redefine my definition of happiness, which I refuse to. Just because there’s people like me who have managed to live a “meaningful” life doesn’t mean I should or could.If I were them I wouldn’t want to live either. Looking and living with my face..as well as imagining my life and future with it..makes me feel like death...like when someone you love dies..that grief. When you cry all the time because you can’t cope with the futility of the situation..there’s nothing you can do and this is your life now and forever. Crying and feeling the worst pain ever..being able to calm down for a while..distracting yourself, participating in life..whatever life looks like for you..only to remember and start crying again. Imagine the first few days or weeks after someones death..but feeling like that every day for months and years. Seeing myself makes me sick, I gag and lose my appetite, will to do anything, if I saw myself..I’d shoot myself in the face. Being at this stage, where I am cold all the time, in pain from not eating, having heart palpitations..feeling like I’m dying..makes me feel happy. People try to warn me, share their concerns..as if they’re not feeding into my disorder. As if death scares me. Honestly, I love seeing myself rot, slowly rotting away, feeling the flesh disappearing,knowing some day I won’t have to be conscious in this body anymore and all that’s going to be left of me is going to be bones. I don’t see how the argument that death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is supposed to help? Define temporary?

“It’s okay not to be okay”;Please shut the fuck up. No, it isn’t. No one really believes that. What you really mean is it’s okay to not be okay as long as it doesn’t affect your life in any way. As long it’s something quirky or fucking cute like anxiety or mild depression (not the crazy bipolar type, though!). As long as you can still be productive and fucking perfect. Schizophrenic? Psychopathic? Paranoid? Terminally angry? You’re a sick freak who needs to be locked up. It’s even worse when it’s schools spouting this hippie, pop-psychology bullshit. You know you’re only trying to cover your bases for when some kid slashes their wrists. I promised I wouldn’t kill myself because I owe it to my parents to outlive them. Fuck that. I won’t even make it to university. This is the third time I’m pulling an all-nighter this week to finish work and I haven’t even been fucking working for the last 6 hours. I don’t feel sad and I don’t even feel tired or numb. I know exactly what I feel. My will to die may finally have overpowered my crippling apathy. I’m not cut out for this world and I’d rather make my parents feel horrible guilt than face their disappointment when I become a useless, alcoholic basket case. Yes, I’m a fucking coward.

I told him “no” and he got pissed.;My uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and I told him no, I can’t take you right now. He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today. I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. Over the word no. He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out. Over the word no. But when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. My dad asked me the other day if I still had my “depression” What the fuck does he think? Edit thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I’m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don’t always fully understand where I’m coming from all of the time so it’s nice seeing that I’m not insane over denying someone else. I managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because I’m starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place I don’t want to be. Thanks again for taking the time to actually listen to what I’m saying.;I told him “no” and he got pissed. My uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and I told him no, I can’t take you right now. He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today. I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. Over the word no. He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out. Over the word no.

Need to put this into words;"I'm really struggling, and have been for a while. I've suffered on and off with depression for the better part of a decade and I'm now a 30 year old male, for reference. Over the past couple of years it's become a lot harder. My grandad passed away in 2019, with whom I was very close and saw a lot of. I still really miss him. With the advent of the pandemic, like many people I switched to working from home. I found the isolation hard, and the working environment more challenging. During this time, I left a team I was happy working with and made to join another area of the business at work. My struggles with my boss and her behaviour has made me really hate work. Work is always on my mind, I struggle to complete the things I need to do as I find it really hard to concentrate. My motivation just isn't there. It's not that I don't want to however or don't care; I then stress and worry about not performing well. It's really impacting my sleep and state of mind, and I'm so behind at work that it's causing problems. I've put on quite a lot of weight over the past year especially which also doesn't help how I feel. I'm bad for comfort eating when I'm feeling low, and that has taken its toll. I haven't said any of the above to anyone, not as it's written here, and I just needed to tell someone. Thank you.";"Need to put this into words I'm really struggling, and have been for a while.

How to deal with stress at work?;I started a new job a few weeks ago and I’ve been so stressed.

Are my parents toxic?;Being an only child, my parents adored me when I was younger. They still do so I’m kinda spoilt I guess. I was sexually abused by my relative for three years when I was a child and I finally told my parents about this two weeks ago. They immediately told me to not tell anyone else about it and to not think much about what happened. It’s not that easy though. I’m getting therapy but I don’t know if I’ll ever be my old self again. To make things worse, they’re still friendly with that relative and just pretend like nothing happened. I don’t understand them at all. I’m still in college and very much dependant on them, so I can’t move out or anything. Should I just ignore what happened like it wasn’t a big deal? It took a lot of courage for me to open up to them and they just brushed it off like it was nothing.;Are my parents toxic? Being an only child, my parents adored me when I was younger.

My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.;So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger. The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup. I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot.

Always stressed about assignments, please help;"So, I'm a college game development student who's just applied for uni and I've also had 3 different units to complete in the past 3 months. I was stressed over my personal statement and my unis of choice; and then even after sending the application, I got stressed over getting a reference and other details. There's also the fact my friend, who I joined this course with, said he won't be applying to uni so I will be all alone even if I do get in (I'm not good at being independent). I applied two weeks ago and yet I constantly stress over the idea of failing to get into uni just for small mistakes in assignments that have yet to be marked. The first unit one was due mid-November and I completed it but I'm stressed over the Harvard referencing because of the font, size and, to be completely honest, I don't know if I even referenced things right. I even noticed just now that in my project proposal, I gave the pathway for my last year course instead of the second year one so I'm scared but at the same time I've seen other proposals and they don't include the pathway so I'm unsure if I'm in the clear or not, ARRGH! The next unit is coming to a close (like a week) and I don't have any development to show for it but I have a ton of research. This is mostly due to it being a team-based unit and we have been unsure as to what we were actually supposed to be making until only a week ago since our tutors kept giving us mixed messages. Lockdown hasn't made anything any better either. We have to work at home now so our teams' communication has gone down the drain. The third unit has just started and it's going to be a specialised study unit which means a lot of it be just trying to find as much information about a couple of different artists. (I'm not too stressed about this unit since I excel at independent study). But it's also a matter of my FMP starting in a couple of weeks which will determine our end of year grade, which will most likely determine whether I get accepted into uni. I received a distinction last year in the first-year course, so all I need this year is to get a merit or higher. HOWEVER, if I only get a pass then I won't have enough tariff points for the uni courses I applied to! I'm incredibly overloaded with stress and I've never really learnt how to get rid of it since my mind is always on overclock just overthinking every minor thing!

Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself;I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F).

At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. Edit I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone.

I'm going to be visiting a trade school on Wednesday. I feel like I actually have direction right now.;After dropping out of college thinking it was the only option out there, I'm glad to be this close to going into trade school and taking a step towards starting my life. I'm excited to think that I will finally have a career and that I could move out. It's crazy to think I could actually start saving up money for bigger things. I could buy a house one day! Sorry for rambling. I'm so tired lol. If anyone reads/responds to this, thank you.;I'm going to be visiting a trade school on Wednesday. I feel like I actually have direction right now.

do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive;and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol;do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol;1;
I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.;"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much. So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.";"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.

Depression makes me SO boring;Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I don't date anyone and never will. Its a reason why I have no friends and never will. Nothing really interests me so I don't have much to talk about. I suck at all conversations and once again I'm so boring. When i was a kid I had a personality I was funny and goofy and happy. Now I'm just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. But my brain is so dead from depression I can't come up with any jokes or shit. The only thing I can do is listen and barely speak which I actually hate. I wanna be funny and have a personality and be desirable but I'm not that. I know its depression that causes it.;Depression makes me SO boring Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I don't date anyone and never will.

Right now in my life I am so frustrated;Right now in my life I am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired. Everyday I search for a moment of happiness to feel good about myself, but there is nothing that makes me feel good. I keep myself busy in my studies(started my masters this August) to take my mind off negative things. but everything around me hits my mind so badly that i cannot control the impact of anything. I no more have control on anything that happens to me, everything just happens and I just respond as I am supposed to. People around me are always demanding, they want something from me every now and then, and its not friendship that they want but just some favors I know they will never return. And right now I don't even have any friends to talk to, to deal with everything with me or even to keep me sane. Everyday has become exhausting and I just feel like to leave everything, do nothing, no studies, no job , no people, leave everything and live somewhere in peace. But I know I cannot just cut off from everything, I have to have masters degree, get a job., but this journey is so stressful, I wish I could have someone just to listen what I have to say about everything going on with me. and I wish I could just get a moment to breathe.;Right now in my life I am so frustrated Right now in my life I am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired.

School is ruining my life;Our school adores examinations, just loves them, and ever since quarantine they’ve increased 3X.

Now I have a boyfriend who * once drove 5.5 hours just to spend a weekend with me * has a goal to make me laugh every day * asked me to write out my family tree so he could memorize everyone's names/facts because he knew how much family means to me * Is the epitome of a healthy, gentle, stable relationship Ever since I was 12 (I'll be 23 on Sunday), I never felt like I'd find someone who would love me so much.

I was home alone the entire day today, so ofc y'all know what that means.....;I cried. I cried almost the entire 7 hours I had the house to myself. I cried without having to hide anything and wherever I felt like. I cried while playing my favourite music loud on my tv. I cried in the balcony, wow that felt good, especially the breeze hitting my face when I stood there nd sobbed. This was nice. My life's an absolute dumpster fire rn nd I'm a fuckin loser, always have been, who's still stuck at his toxic parents' place. No aspect of my life is right rn, be it mentally, emotionally, physically, financially etc etc u name it. True rock bottom. I needed this. I needed these 7 hours of crying nd just sitting nd staring at the blank wall with no need of closing the doors or fearing that someone might catch me. I'm glad I got this. I'll probably not cry myself to sleep today after many many days.;I was home alone the entire day today, so ofc y'all know what that means..... I cried.

School pressure;I am currently doing A-levels and I am in my final year, in year 13. No matter what I do I cannot force myself to study. I can’t study more than five minutes because I just feel like crying whenever I study I don’t know what is wrong with me. I know and love education because I know it is the key to success and education is vital to life. I love the importance of it and know how privileged I am to receive an education. But somehow I cannot study and Do anything school related. I’m trying to talk to people around me about it but I just feel like crying because no one understands how I feel. I want to study but I can’t and every time I just feel like crying because I feel like I’m failing in my education. I am scared that if I feel I would let my family down. I think I may be scared of the idea of failing and letting my family down or it could be that school is sucking the fun out of education for me. Also, sometimes I feel like my education will go to waste because I am not allowed to work because I have to take care of someone and my dad brings the income. I feel like the main goal right now is to study and I’m failing because 1) I feel that I’m too scared to start studying because I will fail and 2) my education will go to waste as I’m not going to work due to other responsibilities so what is the point of studying? I’m not exactly sure what it is and my feelings are mixed. Sometimes I also worry about the future and think like if I feel my education and I am not working or doing anything I’m just at home feeling like a waste of space. I’m so confused. Can someone please help me out with suggest what I should do? Ps. Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense because I’m literally just feeling a mix of emotions and different things and it is just all a big mess.;School pressure I am currently doing A-levels and I am in my final year, in year 13.

I feel like I’m falling in a bottomless pit;I’m currently 17 which I know is young but I just can’t seem to find any sort of hope for me to carry on and continue living. I feel as though I can’t catch a break it’s just continuous L after another like I’ve hit rock bottom but the ground gives way and I fall down even further. I used to get along with everyone but either the people I have trusted no longer want to talk to me or the friends I have now are just dickheads who make me feel like I’m not cared and that I’m a piece of shit but I only choose to hangout with them cause they are all they I have left in terms of people to talk to. Doesn’t help either that a girl I loved has abandoned me after telling her how I felt and whom I thought was the only person I could go to for help when I was down. She has made me more upset as she knew what I was going through with my depression and loneliness but she still left me. I’ve also had to give up some activities like my favourite sport baseball because I wasn’t mentally fit to play anymore and would have breakdowns on the bench or lash out at my teammates when they got on me for something because I didn’t do something right. Worst part is that when I left the team has played better without me making me feel even shittier than I was to begin with. I’m currently in therapy and am on meds but I can’t help about how I want to die so badly or harming myself whenever I get the chance.

Just paid off my $9k credit card balance I started 11 years ago!;I had to share this because honestly what an incredible sense of relief! About 11 years ago, I made a big purchase in the form of a $4,000 camera bundle. It slowly spiraled out of control after that with my credit card balance reaching upwards to $9k at it's peak a couple years back. But it is now done. I was stupid and it was my own fault, but it's still an accomplishment! Wish everyone the best of luck in paying off whatever debt you may have! ;Just paid off my $9k credit card balance I started 11 years ago! I had to share this because honestly what an incredible sense of relief! About 11 years ago, I made a big purchase in the form of a $4,000 camera bundle.

Having a bad day ?;Ahh damnit it’s that day that comes now and then isn’t it ? Or that day that keeps coming every day and keeps you in bed ! Depression is very personal , you may be having a shit month because your sister died , your boyfriend of 7 years cheated on you , your cat was run over , your boss fired you and now you have to get rid of your car. Fuck sake , life is shit hey ! Why does everyone else have it so god damn easy ! Yes I know the Africans don’t have water but my pain is real and I can’t carry on ! I don’t want you to read this and carry on moping and feeling sorry for yourself , You are not a victim , get over it. As soon as you read this turn off your phone and embrace the open air and walk outside. I don’t care if your at work , it’s raining , you are somewhere important just do it. When you are outside slap yourself really hard on the face or ask someone to do it , feel some pain on your face , splash water in your face. You are not dead , you are still alive , very alive. Tomorrow can be shit , hell your dad died last week , maybe your mom will die tomorrow. BUT, tomorrow is a chance of not changing your life, like we are in some Hollywood movie , tomorrow is a chance maybe to have 1 smile , maybe a hug ? Maybe your friend might make you laugh on the phone. Depression is the inability to face our reality , we cannot face it and we therefore just shut off and wither until we end up slitting the wrist. Face it now and fight , depression is the hardest battle to face but the easiest to win , it’s just beating urself.

Feeling happy to have some close friends;For as long as I can remember, I was always moving houses with my family, and when I moved houses I always had to make new friends. From the start to the end of my schooling I went to about eight schools so I was never there for too long. I always knew that going to a new school I would have fun and enjoy my time there, but in the back of my mind I had to remember that the people I know now may not always be there. I’m finally at a place where I have a good handful of close friends and I never thought I’d be there, its nice knowing that there is someone there just a message away and wanting to listen and have a chat. Just a little win and wanted to share );Feeling happy to have some close friends For as long as I can remember, I was always moving houses with my family, and when I moved houses I always had to make new friends.

Won some money at the casino and now I’m gonna spend my winnings at Jack And the Box.;I did pretty well playing slots. Walked into the casino 5 days ago with $73 and just walked out with $81.

Here’s what they are A Jumba-Jack with cheese Two tacos with refried beans and cheeses that are just so dang spicy that I can’t even believe it I was really hoping I’d win enough money at the casino to change my living situation (at one point I was up $6,000 grand but couldn’t stop playing because I had already committed to staying a couple more days) and I gotta say I feel pretty good managing to walk out from the crazy place up a few bucks.;Won some money at the casino and now I’m gonna spend my winnings at Jack And the Box.

School is getting overwhelming. Feeling extremely stressed.;My schoolwork is piling up because of this pandemic. I’m always stressed all the time and I’m worried I might flunk.

Dealing with Anxiety at Work;I’m a new lawyer and am constantly getting anxiety about making mistakes.

How I overcame my pornography addiction & why I started to change my life for the better.;This is tough for me to talk about but I thought this story will help inspire men. Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you.

For those of you doing okay in school, how do you find the motivation for assignments?;"I'm practically a minute from graduating and I can't seem to get my shit together enough to pass my last few classes. Some days I can't find the motivation to get out of bed; every day I struggle to do so even if I do eventually get up. I really struggle to find the motivation to take my nightly asthma medicine. My apartment is still a fucking nightmare because I haven't found the motivation to do the basic tasks of unpacking and cleaning. I have cauliflower rotting in my trash making me nauseous nearly every day because taking the bag to the dumpster is such a herculean task. I have trouble finding the motivation to text my family back most days. Doing my job, the thing that pays me and enables me to have my apartment, takes some serious motivation. So, yeah.

idk what to do;I’ve been depressed for about 8 years now & it’s just been gradually getting worse ever since, i’ve tried numerous times to get help, i went to the mental health hospital for a week 2 months ago & im currently on Lithium, it helped for the first few weeks but now i just feel the same, i don’t like to tell anybody about it because i always feel like i’m repeating myself, my family gets frustrated, friends barely listen, i try to keep myself busy & do things i enjoy but i always end up feeling the same, i’ve never been this low in my life nor have i ever disliked it this much. i just want to feel okay & feel like i’m not wasting away anymore. i feel like i’ve tried everything & i just need to hang up the towel & finally off myself like i’ve wanted to for these past 8 years but i just can never bring myself to do so because of my family, if it wasn’t for them i’d be long gone;idk what to do I’ve been depressed for about 8 years now & it’s just been gradually getting worse ever since, i’ve tried numerous times to get help, i went to the mental health hospital for a week 2 months ago & im currently on Lithium, it helped for the first few weeks but now i just feel the same, i don’t like to tell anybody about it because i always feel like i’m repeating myself, my family gets frustrated, friends barely listen, i try to keep myself busy & do things i enjoy but i always end up feeling the same, i’ve never been this low in my life nor have i ever disliked it this much. i just want to feel okay & feel like i’m not wasting away anymore. i feel like i’ve tried everything & i just need to hang up the towel & finally off myself like i’ve wanted to for these past 8 years but i just can never bring myself to do so because of my family, if it wasn’t for them i’d be long gone;1;

What are my best options out of this burnout?;Hi guys, Pretty sure I’ve got burnout and I’d live to know your thoughts on what’s some options to get out of this hole. I can’t even think straight so planning an exit route from this mess it’s proving hard. I’ll do a very brief overview of the situation. Male 39 3 months ago I was training for a ultra run. I’ve been very active all my life. Energy has never been an issue. During the training I started a new job after losing my previous job due to the pandemic. It’s been a massive step outside my comfort zone and I’ve been stressed almost daily for a few month now. The problem started after I did the ultra run. The week after I was tired as I expected but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point I couldn’t even walk up stairs. Fast forward 3 months. I’ve not been able to do any exercise, my sleep is a mess, I have dry mouth all the time and I’ve got super bad brain fog. I don’t want to lose this job, it’s a serious career opportunity and could set me up for life and I don’t think it would be that hard if my brain was working properly. I should Mention that I’ve had my blood tested by the doctor and there was nothing wrong. I feel like I’m stuck In a cycle where I need to relax but my work is keeping me in a stressed state so I can’t relax and that means that my burnout is never going to go away. I do have holidays coming up, I’m just praying that my brain is going to reset itself but the same time I’m seriously worried that if I’m still knackered by the end of holiday which I think could be very possible then I’m going to go back into a busy year of work and I am never going to break out of this cycle. I’ve been living at home with my parents for the last year because I lost my previous job and I need to move out. I’m ready to buy house but I’m really struggling with the extra pressure of even looking for a house with the way my brain is at the moment. I know no job is worth giving yourself bad health but I don’t actually think it’s the job, I think that something has gone wrong with my body and the job is not helping but I don’t think necessarily that the job itself is what’s caused this, it’s a combination of maybe overtraining for running combined with the stress of the lockdown and not seeing anyone for year(my parents are isolating), ending of a big relationship I had previous and the work pressure, everything mixed into one somehow has just caused my body to to shut down. The question, How do I get out of this without losing my job? I’ve Been thinking maybe I need to go on medication to break the cycle of the stress so I can sleep better not be stressed every day at work and then my body will relax and reset. I know Antidepressants might be an option but I feel like they’re just a double edge sword/patch and I’ll just have a bunch of problems later on down the line to deal with coming off them. Would love to know Your thoughts on this situation, maybe you’ve been there and found a way back to full energy, thanks for your time;What are my best options out of this burnout?

Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident;I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun.;Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually.

I'm stressed about my upcoming birthday;"I am a soon to be 14M who was born on the 25 of March. A few months back, y parents began asking what I want for my birthday. They offered hoodies, even 100 bucks. I declined, because I felt like if I responded, they would think I am some a-hole child who EXPECTS something for his birthday. Hence, I declined. But the sooner my birthday is approaching, the more stressed I get, because a few days ago, I finally realized what I wanted. This thing costs 36 bucks, but I need 50 bucks to purchase something that'll help me gain this thing. Thing is, I've already asked my mother if I could use my own money for this thing, and she said something like ""no, it's best to keep the cash for bad times, etc"" (referring to the recent pandemic). Another thing is that she has already lost one job due to the virus, and my dad isn't gaining much either. We are stabl3, we have good amounts of resources, and really everything is going just as it always has. But the problem is I feel selfish. I feel like they had already gotten something for me, and if I ask for money, they would have just already wasted it on something else they planned to give me. I feel like I should've came up with what I wanted earlier, before the pandemic and everything. I feel anxious whenever I ask for something, even though they want to give me something. Overall, I feel like an idiot and a selfish person. I can't even tell whether or not I should tell them what I want or not. I'm just worried over this thing that I reckon I'm over-thinking. If you could give me advise on what to do, that would be appreciated. Thank you for reading ) .";"I'm stressed about my upcoming birthday I am a soon to be 14M who was born on the 25 of March.

I feel like I should've came up with what I wanted earlier, before the pandemic and everything. I feel anxious whenever I ask for something, even though they want to give me something. Overall, I feel like an idiot and a selfish person. I can't even tell whether or not I should tell them what I want or not. I'm just worried over this thing that I reckon I'm over-thinking. If you could give me advise on what to do, that would be appreciated. Thank you for reading ) .";1;
Ever wake up in the morning and immediately fill with dread that you have to go through the agony of another day?;Going to sleep is my favorite thing bc I can shut off everything else.

"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?";Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time.;"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?

I am panicking from stress and I don't know why;Today i woke up pretty okay (for a person on psych drugs but they are lightweight). But it all went to shit wdith the course of day. Nothing bad happen, even the opposite i got a commision for art, gave a good presentation, handed in an essay, etc. But I feel absolutly awful i can't focus, my mental stability (already bad) is going to shit and I have no idea why and this scares me even more and sets me on the verge of mental breakdown. Im so scared I don't know what to do. How can I do anything about it? I don't have anything that calms me, even the cigarettes don't work, my meds are for sth else and I feel helpless. I don't want my suicid thoughts to storm me. Inb4 see a psychiatrist, the closest I have is an appointment in april because I had to change my psych.;I am panicking from stress and I don't know why Today i woke up pretty okay (for a person on psych drugs but they are lightweight).

Now that school is over and stress is going away, I should feel fine, but I actually feel weird.

"Girlfriend with depression says she feels ""numb"" and just wants to be alone. What to do?";Hello dear people. So my girlfriend was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and she had a burnout because of her work. She has been on meds and seeing a therapist about a year now. For the past two weeks she said that she feels nothing about everything (numb) and wants to be alone. She doesn't answer calls from anyone and little chores feel like hell for her. I have been trying to help by cleaning etc... Now she said that she wants me to go away but still loves me very much. What should I do? Should I respect her wishes and go to live with my dad for some time or just be here for her? Should I wait her to contact me and tell her that I am here for her if she needs anything or what? It hurts so much seeing someone you love like this.;"Girlfriend with depression says she feels ""numb"" and just wants to be alone. What to do? Hello dear people.

Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this?

I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed;"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore. tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore";"I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once.

Why I hate watching scary movies.;I watched the movie Midsomer and I have not been able to get it out of my head. I hate watching scary movies but in the past I would get over them in about a day or so because the things in them were fake. Things like ware wolves, ghosts, vampires, immortal men running around killing people and other things that don’t exist. But Midsomer...? It’s a story that’s plausible. If you don’t know what it is, it’s about a cult. And it’s fucked up. That movie, I have not been able to get over and it’s been 4 days. It’s giving me anxiety. I keep thinking morbid things will happen to me or the people around me. I havnt been able to sleep with my door open or the lights off, my boyfriend has had to stay the night every night because otherwise I can’t sleep. I’m 23 years old and I work in an ER where I see actual injuries and people actually die and that doesn’t keep me up at night. But that movie has screwed with my head. I hate watching scary movies and I only watch them with my family once a year, which is around Halloween. My family states that my “immunity” does not exist in the month of October. I know this is page is about stress but that movie has given me so much anxiety that I feel stressed. I havnt drank soda in four days because my heart feels like it’s racing all the time and I know caffeine and sugar will only make it worse. Not sure what to do to get over this. I’ve never been affected by a movie this way before.;Why I hate watching scary movies. I watched the movie Midsomer and I have not been able to get it out of my head.

Not wanting to live and wanting to die are two very different things imo;"Many people don't seem to understand, that when I say things like ""I don't want to exist"" or ""I wish I could disappear"", I don't mean ""I want to k*ll myself"".

For the first time in life, I’m confidently, madly in love with someone;I’m madly in love It’s brought me to tears thinking about her and looking at her... Not a single person in my life has made me feel what she’s made me feel. It’s so overwhelming it leaves me speechless, not in any bad way, in a serene way that brings me peace. I love who she is, how she looks, how she expresses herself, how she thinks, her personality, how passionate she is about her interests, and how she treats me. I feel more valued, heard, safe, and appreciated than I ever have in my life. I want to grow with her and be there with her through the ups and downs of life. I want the best for her, and to be happy in life, and feel free to do whatever fulfills her. She’s strong enough to do anything and I want her to know that and conquer whatever faces her. I can tell her anything and she accepts it with an open heart. She enjoys taking care of me. She checks in and cares about my mental well being. She respects my boundaries strictly as I do hers, and we express them fully so each other understands. She makes me feel like the most important and beautiful person on earth...
