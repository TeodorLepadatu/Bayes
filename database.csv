Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood?;I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over. I just have a pit and emptiness in my stomach that I don’t see going away long-term. 4 years ago, my mom killed herself, and I found the body. Safe to say, my childhood was a shit show of fear, emotional manipulation, feeling like a parent to my parent, despair, fighting etc. I live with my dad and sister now. My dad is a really nice guy, but has ZERO emotional intelligence. The other night, I was crying and screaming to him about how I wanted to kill myself and some other problems, and all he did was look at me with a blank expression and say he would call the police. He says he is worried about me, but I have never once felt emotionally conncected to him. I feel empty. My psych told me I have disorganised attachment style which Is apparently the worst. Coupled with the fact that I hate myself like poison and don’t think I deserve that to change, the future doesn’t seem very bright. On top of that, I think I got my mum’s good old depression gene. It seems my life is on a trajectory that is all too familiar. I feel as though I and floating in space, all alone, unable to connect to anyone because of what I’ve gone through. I am far more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my social circle, so while I’m always helping them, I have no one to begin to help me. Interactions are fun, but always empty. Everything is empty. I have no rules or discipline at all. Never have. Don’t care enough about myself to create it for myself. That’s my rant. Any advice?;Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood? I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over.

I’m finding it hard to find a reason to get up in the mornings again.;Isn’t it so horrible that, I don’t really want to die, but I also just like don’t really want to do anything at all? Like I kind of wish I could just sleep. Or maybe just like lay in bed all day. I don’t want to be lazy but at the same time I don’t want to do anything. I feel like I don’t deserve to live and Im just wasting space. Like there’s people that actually were going to be someone and do something with their life, who have just died. and i’m here wasting my life and wasting the space. I wish i could give my life to someone more meaningful.;I’m finding it hard to find a reason to get up in the mornings again.

I convinced myself I was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks. Then I walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful, loving family. Now I cant stop crying;I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way.;I convinced myself I was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Ive decided to get admitted to a hospital instead of just killing myself;Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone;Ive decided to get admitted to a hospital instead of just killing myself Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times.

I’m doing well, but not feeling well.;A reflection. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. I’m in my 40s, in a middle managemnet position and am finishing up my first semester of graduate business school. I’m happily married and my husband loves me. All my needs are met financially. I’m doing well in all of these areas of life, exceeding even. But I’m also struggling deeply. I can’t sleep. I feel sick sometimes. I’m exhausted. I can’t wind down. My social life is nonexistent. I love my job. I love school. I get a high from both. But the relentless demands are killing me. It literally hurts when i try to relax. It makes me want to go be an Amish or something. Is this just life? Do I need to suck it up and be grateful for what I have? I believe all things worth having are worth working for. But I’m scared I can’t cut it.

LoL Im trapped in hell;Literally every little thing that goes wrong couses me unberarble emotional pain, everything hurts so much and there is no escape exept death.

Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.];"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life.

I'm not lazy at school, I just need some understanding is all.;I have to go back to physical school tomorrow and I dread it. School is one of the reasons I wanted to die. I'm particularly good at maths but my memory is so awful I can't remember anything at all and that's how I score so less in exams. I'm traumatized of ever getting anything average because of the times I've been beaten by my parents or punished or have the one thing taken from that motivates me to even get up. I don't even have access to means of killing myself. I can't jump off a building because I live in a short building. Tried choking myself but I bailed out at the last second. No pills to OD on and I'm too weak mentally to slit my wrists. I'm so socially awkward, I constantly disappoint those around me and I feel terrible. It hurts. I wish I could just have a job that didn't require me to be smart. I'm not. It doesn't help that I also have ADHD and the shortest attention span. I cannot concentrate on anything. So tomorrow I go back to school and none of my notes and assignments are done and I barely know anything. Can't wait to get a complaint from my teachers and get the shit beaten out of me again. Before you say to call the cops or anything on my parents....I can't...I love them too much. I'm too mentally weak to do anything to hurt anyone. Idk why I am like this. If you read this, I'm sorry.

Please tell me it gets easier;Hi all. I am two years into my career with a new mortgage. I live out in the suburbs in a townhouse. I make $83K per year and my mortgage payment is $1,450 with $250 HOA fees and utilities.... etc. I probably should have decided on a smaller place or continued to rent. I feel like I am in over my head sometimes with the bills I need to pay. Work stress + living alone for the first time + stress on staying on top of payments. I just feel in over my head and so stressed. I still have recurring subscriptions that I have not cancelled that I am being charged monthly fees for. I just need support and I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I never learned how to budget very well growing up and I feel like I am drowning. Any tips or words of support welcomed. I just feel so alone and overwhelmed. Thank you.;Please tell me it gets easier Hi all. I am two years into my career with a new mortgage. I live out in the suburbs in a townhouse.

Screen Time Negatives;I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone. Now I’ve extended this late night indefinitely as I labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens.

23yo Male. Losing my best friend;I have lost who I considered my best friend. She told me that she never really cared about me and that she didn't care about losing me. Whenever I tried to spend time with her she made excuses to me and recently I have learned that it was all lies. She knew that she was the only person I trusted and she knows everything about me, and yet she hasn't minded seeing me hurt. I don't know if I can trust someone again. Really now I notice that I have no one. I just needed to express what I feel. I only want to die. ps I've been with depression and generalized anxiety disorder since 2017;23yo Male.

Losing Streak;I feel like I'm really close to the end of my rope. I can't remember the last time I've caught a break, it's just been shitty news followed by more shitty news. Things dont get better, but sometimes after a few days of wallowing I'll feel just a shred of tranquility in my life, just for it to get yanked out from under me. At this stage even the littlest things just throw me off the edge and I'll spiral back into all these dark thoughts. I just feel like I'm broken and I dont belong in this world. idk i just want this pain to end;Losing Streak I feel like I'm really close to the end of my rope.

So stressed out it’s become a multitasking event;I’ve just noticed recently. I’ve got so much random stuff I’m stressed about my mind can wonder and stress out while I’m doing other stuff that normally kept my mind occupied. The most annoying is listening to music, and I don’t mean as background noise. Music used to be a good escape. Now I got a full blown rap coming out of my mouth as fast as it can move and simultaneously have my head stressing out in detail with what ifs about something I need to do tomorrow. Some of my work has a lot of numbers and data entry to it. I can be waist deep in numbers typing away and my mind is stressing out about something stupid in full detail again. I don’t even hold conversations while I’m doing my data work cause I know I’ll mess it up and I can’t focus on both but I can hold an entire conversation in my head and do it somehow. It’s so annoying I have no where to get peace now.;So stressed out it’s become a multitasking event I’ve just noticed recently.

School during Covid sucks;I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students. We just had midterms this week and it was fucking hell. I studied all week, barely slept and ate, and I’m just so tired of it all. Not to mention we have psats in a day and none of the teachers or even my parents said anything to me. I have extracurriculars that take time and I don’t know how to do anything right anymore. I’m just tired and stressed all the time and it’s in a cycle that just keeps going. I’m only in highschool and I already feel like my life is falling apart. I can’t seem to focus and I can’t seem to get anything done on time. I’ve lost all motivation to do school work. I used to love school and seeing my friends and now I’d rather fucking kill myself than deal with this anymore. But then I feel bad because I know there’s people with a lot worse problems than me so I’m sorry if I made anyone feel annoyed that was not my intention. I’m just tired and I need to get all this tension out.;School during Covid sucks I swear my teachers don’t even care about any of their students.

I’m just tired and stressed all the time and it’s in a cycle that just keeps going. I’m only in highschool and I already feel like my life is falling apart. I can’t seem to focus and I can’t seem to get anything done on time. I’ve lost all motivation to do school work. I used to love school and seeing my friends and now I’d rather fucking kill myself than deal with this anymore. But then I feel bad because I know there’s people with a lot worse problems than me so I’m sorry if I made anyone feel annoyed that was not my intention. I’m just tired and I need to get all this tension out.;1;
Please i need a break so badly;Shits been rough. Looking back at the last 10 years all I can think is, why couldn't I just fucking chillllll I ran full speed into every bad decision, made every wrong choice. Every life lesson I've learned I learned the hard way.. and am still paying for all of it. I basically threw it all out the window. All the important things. Education, Family, Freedom. No education, betrayed family, I'm dependent on the government and kindness of a coworker to support my 2 little boys and myself, my job doesn't pay the rent to say the least, but I've got not qualifications, no ged or hs diploma. I guess my point is I'm so stressed and I need a break so badly. I'm tearing up writing this part, ugh. Anyway.. Im not religious but I beg god to give me a break dozens of times a day. But I don't think I deserve a break. I think I deserve to feel this pain and worry after hurting all the people who cared about me so much, and making bad life decisions leads to consequences.. now I'm living with my consequences and it's so horrible..I just want to scream and cry. But instead I go under the blanket like now, write down my thoughts and try to breathe it out and think of good things I can do to fix it. I need to study I need to get my ged certificate I need to find a job I need to get my license I need to move somewhere with good schools I need to create a stable life for my boys before struggling is all they can remember.;Please i need a break so badly Shits been rough.

Trying medication again/A needed ramble;Hi I’m new here. I’ve battled with depression for maybe 15 years? Or more I don’t even know. The last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with Covid. I’m honestly sick of hearing about covid. My grandmother died a year ago and I feel like that’s when things made a turn for the worse. Her death was horrible. It wasn’t sudden but it wasn’t expected. Her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and I had to watch everyday for two months. It was traumatizing. My anxiety had become so unbearable I reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed Prozac which I had used before and it helped. This time it helped but then I found it started making me incredibly angry and worse. So I went off and tried to just deal with it. Because there are good days where I do feel fine. But then it started happening again so I reached out to a psychotherapist. She helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood I had so now more trauma has been brought up. I feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well. Like working night shifts(which I should be getting off soon hopefully), a renovation to our only bathroom that started in April and still isn’t done.. body image issues like crazy. I have 1 friend but I try not to vent to her because I hate being so negative all the time. Friends are so hard to make for me. Anyway I have a lot going on. I made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist. While my husband just stood there and didn’t comfort at all. He actually just left the room as I cried in a ball. Anyway I’ll wrap this up as I should probably go to sleep in prep for work. Ugh.;Trying medication again/A needed ramble Hi I’m new here.

Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.;I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. But That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep. I cry when I wake. I crave death. There are so many methods. It all causes pain. But I can't feel them. I can't process emotions. What is pain? Sounds like something I know. I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.;Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.

Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.;To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week. First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad. I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this. Edit Thank you for the support everyone. I can't reply to every comment but be sure that your words mean a lot to me );Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.

My symptoms 1,5 years after Burning out ( & getting Diagnosed with Fatigue Syndrome );Hey guys, So a while back I did a post about the symptoms to look for when fearing burnout is around the corner ( LINK IN THE END OF THE POST). It was quite appreciated, so thought I'd do a little follow-up on how it's been going to recover and later also talk about how I lived that caused the burnout. So I started with recording a video sharing all the symptoms I still live with more than 1,5 years after the crash. Not to make people feel sorry for me, but because I want you to realize that there REALLY is a COST to working 24/7. Even if it's super fun and you feel like you have all the energy in the world. Like I did. Also, I just want to say, I LOVE LIFE AND THIS EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME LOVE IT EVEN MORE. LIFE IS FRAGILE - CHERISH IT!!

Am I Not in Control?;Does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way? Like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all. Your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy. In social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something. It's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything. I have a lot of stressors in my life, and I can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that I've become subject to these things. I've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than I thought I'm capable of. How do people function with high stress? How do you groom yourself to do that? I've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been;Am I Not in Control?

Staying busy to stay out of my own head.

The first 3 months were rough, but I learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well. ;Staying busy to stay out of my own head.

Could this all be stress from an exam?;Sorry for long post. 25M. The last month I have no clue what’s going on. It started with an internal hemorrhoid that seems to have gone now, but right after my bowel habits changed for the first time in my life. I’m not sure if I was constipated because I was still going in some fashion and it was soft. I also started to get back aches, especially in the lower back. My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it. I took a laxative after my exam and that relieved the back pain and trouble, but since I’ve had an on and off burning sensation in my stomach, lower abdomen, and even thighs at time. The thighs have gone but it almost feels like there is a tight rubber band around my waist at times with an uncomfortable burning feeling. I do have anxiety troubles but I’m in CBT and things have been awesome. My GP said IBS but blew it off, and another GI guy just said Colonoscopy instantly. I saw one more person this week and he gave me some antispasmodics to try first before any colonoscopy. What’s weird is since I talked to him yesterday, the last day and a half, my symptoms have been just about nonexistent. Can’t be a coincidence can it? I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?;Could this all be stress from an exam?

One of the worst side effects of my depression is the brain fog, but I never see anyone talk about it.;I don't know if this is the correct term to use for what I am referring to, but I feel like I can't be living the same way most human do. The best way I can describe it is that I'm only using 1% of my brain lol. I used to be a smart and intuitive girl, but for the past couple of years it's like I have no idea what's going on around me, I can't remember anything, I feel so fucking dumb all the time, and everything feels blurry and confusing. I think I've been holding in too much and my body and brain are shutting down. That's my best guess. Edit Wow! Just wanted to say another thank you to everyone sharing their experiences here, I feel way less alone, and ashamed. I can relate to so, so many of you. red_heart ;One of the worst side effects of my depression is the brain fog, but I never see anyone talk about it.

The thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on Bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today.;I came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble. Not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but I’m happy we matched. We went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date. Fast forward a year later, he requested me randomly on Instagram. Which we had never shared with each other. I messaged him and the next week we were on a date. It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we’ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. It may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him. Last year before we met again he had a plan to move back East after college. This year, he stayed in my state with me.

For the first time in 4 years, I feel hopeful for what the future holds for me.;I've never really been hopeful for anything. And if I have been, it's never lasted for more than an hour. My expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment. This has worked well for me, with minimal hurt from hoping too much. But. I don't need to do that anymore. I don't necessarily know why, but since June, I've been looking forward to waking up every morning. Actually, I know why. It's because the belief that I had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong. Completely wrong. It's so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time. For the past few years, I've been wallowing in my depression. I feared death but at the same time craved it. So, as foolish as I was. I tried. Failed. And regretted backing out for about 8 months. Mainly because I was now on people's watchlist. I had a fear of pills for a while. Just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn. I would constantly lay in bed, stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me. So I acted impulsively. If I was gonna go. I was going to go out with a bang. I fractured my hand. Had a scrap with my Bastard of a Parent. Attempted. Planned another. But at the same time, I desperately hung on. I didn't really want to die. No one really does. A close friend of mine dragged me out. I will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me. She let me stay. And I've realized, her family is the polar opposite of mine. Calm and quiet majority of the times. Full of fun. Laughter. They don't raise hands or lace poison in their words. I didn't know that this was possible. For me to be happy for more than an hour. For me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed. Where my mental illness is not a myth. Where my feelings don't have to be locked away. I feel so validated and unconditionally loved. I want to start getting professional help. To better myself. I feel like with this. I can keep pushing forward. That I will keep standing up after falling down. No matter how many times that will be. I don't know why, but I feel happy to be here.;For the first time in 4 years, I feel hopeful for what the future holds for me. I've never really been hopeful for anything.

I feel like with this. I can keep pushing forward. That I will keep standing up after falling down. No matter how many times that will be. I don't know why, but I feel happy to be here.;1;

My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.;"A bit of background My sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme, we're talking cops at our door, constant trips to the hospital, alternate schooling and the whole lot. She needs 24/7 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times. I currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her. Me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress, and since I have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because I just sit and get angry about whats going on at home. Now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house, weve lived there for over 13+ years, been good tenants and always paid rent on time, he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell. Its all super illegal but thats a completely different story. We have 2 months to leave, our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices (we live in a big city) and landlords are ridiculous here, super scummy, they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application. Even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central. Ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister. She needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers, schooling and the lot, its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it. I drive and work fulltime I can go where ever I want. My mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid. I dont want to deal with them anymore, the constant violent out bursts, the screaming and crying, everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress. I had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work. The dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot. Now when I suggested going our seperate ways to my mom I offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent I could spare, it ended with her screaming and crying that I was abandoning her. This makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more. What route do I take? I know moneys already very tight for her and I love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and I want to grow as a person and live my life. Tldr; my family struggles with mental health and I have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need.";"My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health.

going insane over politics;I AM STUCK IN A HOUSE WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS. I live in the Midwest, and I’m a senior in high school, and I can’t fucking wait to get the hell out of this suffocating place. And I can bite my tongue and handle my immediate family supporting Trump most of the time. But I just can’t fucking do it anymore. I just can’t. I broke tonight at the dinner table and slammed my hand on the table and yelled at my brother. I was talking, having a conversation about how I wasn’t comfortable going out to a restaurant because of COVID, and he rolled his eyes at me and said “Oh my God.” And I screamed “WHAT” back at him and put my dishes away and went upstairs. Now I’m in trouble for screaming. I fucking hate it here. I’m full of rage and anger and I can’t go for a drive because my car is broken right now. I needed to vent.

College Student;So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do. Im Turing 21 in a couple of months and now just had a realization that no this is not what I want to pursue, so I applied to switch my major. Thankfully, the 32 credits can be applied towards the degree. However, Im turning 21 I feel like others around me have accomplished so much, and completing their degrees. Its just so overwhelming, and I feel like now my whole life timeline has been completely thrown off. Im back at square one with 4 years of college to go. I feel so stressed out.;College Student So I started off intending to pursue something else in college, I spent the past two years and had taken 32 credits geared to what I thought I originally wanted to do.

Today I got invited to a wedding and was told I was the reason they met!;I’ve been on a bit of a downer recently but this has made me so happy! I spend a month every year in South Korea. Back in 2019, I planned a trip to the coast for just myself but decided to invite a friend of mine. She asked me if she could make it a big trip and bring 15 people I’d never met before. I said yes because I love meeting new people and I love the international community in SK. I booked 2 earlier extra days just for myself so I was there Thursday- Monday and she booked a 15 person house in the same airbnb right by my room for Sat-Monday. So I went and enjoyed two blissful days sat on the balcony and walking around the coast. On the saturday they all arrived, 2 different groups of friends my friend had got together to come down. We all had a wonderful time meeting each other, having bbqs, playing games, watching the sunset on the ocean etc Well today, I got a message on FB from a couple I met there. She was asking me to join their wedding via zoom and told me that they actually met on that trip. They wanted me, someone they’d only met for 2 days, to be at their wedding, because I was the one who had helped them meet! I am just so so so thrilled!!! I thought they already were together on that trip, I had no idea!

I want to get help;Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends. Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help?

I almost killed myself today;I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out.

I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me. Edit I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness.

My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that.

I just realised today that I have paid off half of my credit card debt;I’ve had this debt for nearly 3 years now, and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it. Over the last 1.5 years though I have been slowly chipping away at it and steadily paying about £21 a month, it’s not much but my financial situation hasn’t been great. Today I have gone to pay my bill and discovered that I have actually paid half already. Plus my financial situation is only improving this year, and hopefully I will soon be able to pay it off completely. Which then means I can start using it responsibly to get my credit score back up, while I save and then be able to get a good rate for a mortgage in a few years time.;I just realised today that I have paid off half of my credit card debt I’ve had this debt for nearly 3 years now, and due to various financial situations it has been hard to clear it.

From the minute I open my eyes, to the minute I close them I am constantly ""doing"" things and feeling like I am a few steps behind. So for me it seems like an ingrained habit that I sort of deault to constantly. Does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being? I do meditate, yoga and those kinds of things but even that can sometimes be a stressful ""must"". Any thoughts would be much appreciated!";"How to get out of the habit of stressing Hi everyone, I have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed.

Balance;I'm struggling lately with managing my heart and mind working in harmony when presented with stress. Where I'm sure in my decisions with with a handful of my most recent stress inducing situations, and how I handled them.. the discordance in others is stifling and I'm not sure how to handle things. The upset causes my emotions to muddy my decisions, and vice versa- and stress seems to be a catalyst in all of it. It's taken its toll on me over time, and I'm worried about damage it's caused, or is causing. Reaching out here to ask how others have found they best handle their own stress and stressful situations? I'm trying to pick up more healthy methods of coping on my own. Thanks.;Balance I'm struggling lately with managing my heart and mind working in harmony when presented with stress.

"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion";"Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?' When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak.""

Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?;I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out. Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health. I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite. Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better” Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

How I lived which eventually made me burned out & get diagnosed with fatigue syndrome;Hey, I'm doing some videos where I share my burnout & fatigue syndrome journey. In my latest, I talk about how my life looked like prior to burning out. Shure, it got more intense the last six months before hitting the wall, but in reality, it started ten years earlier when I started studied to get a master's degree in engineering. In short. I kept myself busy ALL the time. I didn't particularly feel that stressed out, I know the 'bad' kind of stress which just cause a tremendous amount of anxiety, and that wasn't very present. But always being 'ON' and just putting in too many work hours per week without any real 'OFF' mood, I think is what eventually broke me.

I cried for the first time in years;The last time I cried before this was around 5 years ago when my dad passed away, this was when I was 14. This time the reason is also a sad one but not related too someone passing away. I think it was an accumulation of not feeling understood, stress for my exams and the realisation that even if I talk to my mother (the only living relative I still have/live with) she can't understand what I'm feeling/going through. We talked for so long and literally 5 minutes later it looks like she forgot all we talked about and continued minimising everthing I said and felt. Afterwards I just walked away and the tears just came. Just had to get this out somewhere;I cried for the first time in years The last time I cried before this was around 5 years ago when my dad passed away, this was when I was 14.

Stressed because of the possible long-term complications of stress;I am under some I consider huge emotional, work & family-related stress right now and have been for at least the last couple years. The situation is not likely to change in the next few months and I feel like I have already gotten so used to it. But sometimes what stresses me out more is when I think about what could be possible long-term complications of the stress I'm having right now. Like everywhere you would read that stress = death and all the diseases caused/promoted by stress. Like yeah I feel pretty stressed out but overall it's still somehow bearable at the moment just because I've gotten so used to it. But what if in a couple years, when I'm finally ready to enjoy my life, I get diagnosed with cancer or some other disease because of the shit I went through?

I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.;Just like the title says I am 58 M. I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to...... Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er. The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through. BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State. Have a good day. ;I am 58 M.

Worst night yet (long rant);I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it. For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!!

I don't even know why I'm depressed;I've been in an endless cycle of momentary happiness and a deep hard drop for so long now. I don't even know why I'm depressed anymore. Most of the things in my life that have kept me down I feel like I've made peace with. I miss feeling happy, like genuine happiness, not where I suppress my sadness and force myself to be happy and put on a brave fave in front of everyone. I had a girlfriend and whenever I tried to talk to her she told me it wasn't her problem and that she couldn't help me (not in so many words but yeah). Now she's gone and I'm doing better cause I have some friends to talk to but that hasn't helped either. I find myself falling again, losing motivation again, feeling like ending it all again. I've contemplated suicide multiple times but I haven't taken the leap just yet. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It seems like I'm only ever happy when I do drugs but I don't have the money for that and I already recovered from an addiction once and I can't fall into one again. Idk why I'm typing this but last time I posted on a subreddit, typing out my feelings really helped.

Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up;"EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat. Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.";"Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Dealing With A Stressful Situation When All Alone;;Dealing With A Stressful Situation When All Alone nan;1;
Money, Games, Nonsense;So I stress about the worst stuff (Things I shouldn't be stressed about) I have recently spent $300 on a roleplaying game for deluxe cars and I'm now starting to regret it realising that I might not stay on that server for less than a year so I'm thinking to myself what was the point I just put $300 in the trash because since they are my only friends and they leave then I would be alone and wouldn't want to stay in that server and then I wouldn't be able to savor the cars that I spent $300 on. I'm also stressing about the same server, I only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year, so I want to spend as much time with them as I can same thing for the $300 I spent. I had to decide to get a job (In game) and wanted to be a police officer which I thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which I realised from one annoying guy so I wanted to quit and be a prison guard which isn't that much of a fun job but I would be with my four friends who work together there. My dad (IRL) told me that I shouldn't quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life. I stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore. I love this server and I want to continue playing on it. I have vowed not to use that much money a game ever again, which is already a start but what has been done is done and I've decided to work with my friends even if the job isn't that cool (cause I want to spend time with them), but I still can't stop stressing about all of it.

Labeled as mature for being apathetic;At a young age I was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions. I thought it was normal up until major life events would happen, whether positive or negative and in between, when I would not feel a single thing except for severe apathy.;Labeled as mature for being apathetic At a young age I was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions.

I am so excited to move to my new hometown;This day is finally in sight and I’ve been waiting for years and it’s finally here! I am finally leaving the ghetto shithole where I’ve suffered and been depressed and wanted to die for 18 long hard years and moving to a resort town of 1500 people near a beautiful beach. My new hometown is away from all the filthy smog in the city, and overall the attitude of the people is miles ahead of my old place. No longer will I be blankly stared at by losers and degenerates. Nowadays I will be waved at and have pleasant conversation with my refined gentlemanly and ladylike neighbours. Now I can safely go for walks to a quiet park that’s not filled with disgusting people and not have to worry about some asshole’s untrained pit-bull or Rottweiler going nuts and attacking me. I also can walk in peace knowing that there aren’t any dipshits driving full speed while having horrible music on full blast. I can hear the birds singing, there’s ample forest that I can likely go hunting in, and I think my romantic and sexual mating chances are very high since there’s lots of beautiful beach babes down a few blocks from my house p. I am so extremely hyped to move there, I’ve been depressed and felt unwelcome long enough. Now it is time to live the high life and embrace my true happy self that’s long waited to truly show. Special thanks to everybody who’s helped me at least survive through the doldrums, you all know who you are. This is straight up one of the best things to ever happen to me ever, period. I am thrilled beyond belief. ));I am so excited to move to my new hometown This day is finally in sight and I’ve been waiting for years and it’s finally here!

Can't afford university;University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby). This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account. Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system. I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date. Thanks to anyone reading this far.;Can't afford university University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed).

Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.;"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.";"Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.";1;
Why do I have to do this?;Most of the time I'm in a good mood, of course I have bad and good days, but sometimes there are those days when everything seems so pointless to me and the pressure just overwhelms me, where I wonder why? Why does everything have to be so shitty, why is everything I do wrong, why am I here, why can't everything be different and why must I put such a high pressure on me, why do I have to be perfect, why can't I just be let go, let me live and not treat me like shit, like an animal that has to be punished for its existence, for its very existence. Wiping out that existence just feels right sometimes.;Why do I have to do this?

Should I tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress?;About 2 years ago, I started having terrible stomach pains all the time, which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that I faced throughout the day. Last year, my father became very worried about this, and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it. My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain. After I explained the situation a little more, he told me that my issues were definitely stress related, and that I should visit a psychiatrist. He also advised me to start taking therapy. I actually used to take therapy for something other than stress. I had been regularly engaging in self harm, and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started. So when my father found out, he asked me to start taking therapy. It worked great, and I loved going, but I think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive. My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities. My father started getting paid around $20,000 more per year after the move, and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable. A few months ago, my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away. But I knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it. I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do. So I started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I thought I would be able to keep up the lie, but the pain seems to only be getting worse.

How do I deal with this;"Hello I'm a 19 year old (f), english is not my first language so sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school.

I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. But at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister.

But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said ""okey"" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. My stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc. Now we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them. All this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that.

A lot of things going wrong. Pain. The pain.;I'm 24, male. I've ruled out costochondritis, now thinking it's GERD. Tickle in the throat, sore chest, pain by armpits. Back pain. Trying to stay calm knowing it isn't my heart. But shit, everything is sore. I get this chest pain, then a sharp tickle in my throat and ear. Hot right heel (yes, by my foot). Sore shoulders. The chest pain is under my breastbone towards my sternum - which I know is usually costo, but I don't know. Doctors haven't diagnosed it. But I do get acid reflux and heartburn. I smoke, but it hurts. The pain always comes when my chest is sore. Is this anxiety making everything worse? Stressed as hell. I was never like this four months ago. Everything is so sudden.

My job is making my depression worse-I’ve cried all day today about going back tomorrow;I used to love my job (I’ve been here for a bit over 2 months) and I still like the work itself and the people I work with. But we got a new supervisor and I’ve been crying pretty much every day. She’s been our supervisor just a few weeks and every meeting she shamed and berates our team for not being productive enough. She has asked me to do things I’m not comfortable doing because of safety (like going into the office at times it’s not required or making calls while driving) and doesn’t respect us. She complains about how I wasn’t properly trained or something and then rarely answers my emails or questions but reminds us frequently she expects replies within 1-2 hours of her contacting us. I’ve been crying all day about going back tomorrow. I’ve never felt so shamed about trying my hardest. I don’t want to quit my job but I seriously cannot do this, my body literally aches thinking about having to get up and work in the morning.;My job is making my depression worse-I’ve cried all day today about going back tomorrow I used to love my job (I’ve been here for a bit over 2 months) and I still like the work itself and the people I work with.

So very happy and excited that I still can’t sleep, and I’m completely exhausted!;Just before the Great Panini began, SO and I moved from Orlando to upper southern Michigan. The plan had been to move to Grand Rapids after a couple of months. The panini turned it into 2 years. I sit here tonight in our hotel room 18 minutes away fro our new home, vibrating from the last round caffeine. We were in a smallish two bedroom while we both work from home. Tomorrow the first round of our belongings will be dropped off at the new place. I will have my own office! SO gets an office/lab, and a two car garage. If the whole thing felt real, I would weep with joy. Instead, it’s edibles and maybe sleeping med.;So very happy and excited that I still can’t sleep, and I’m completely exhausted!

Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever;I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly. I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will. I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me. And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them. But, it helped so much. Honestly. Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care. To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life. I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone. She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen. She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice. Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge. Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore. Thank you stranger.

I’m trying really hard but he says I’m not trying enough.;My left arm and hand is anxious, haven’t had over four hours of sleep everyday. Im eating one meal a day at the most. The rest of my body is starting to feel like my left arm. Stressing over a relationship I might have ruined and can’t find a way to recover from this. I’m getting kicked out of the army, also my relationship has fallen apart because of me and idk how to get things back to the way it was in the beginning of my relationship… He tells me he doesn’t know if he wants to be with me, yet I don’t have more than a month left in Germany.

i’m 17 and my mom just died.;I’m gonna keep it short. Around 10 30 am i heard my brother scream is she dead?! I jolted up and walked out, there i see my mom dead on the floor with my dad trying CPR. We’re pretty sure she overdosed. No one saw this coming. I’m devastated. She was my best friend. Millions of memories with her helping and loving me. My family is struggling. I need help. I can’t live with this feeling. She was my best friend. I love her so much. Anything that can help me? Thanks for all your honest answers, it just doesn’t feel real, i just feel like she’s gonna walk into my bedroom with food and give me a nice hug (;i’m 17 and my mom just died.

I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?;I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma. Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine! About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it. And now I’m worried that my heart will give in due to stress. How do I get over it and stop stressing about stuff? ;I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?

Feeling trapped in endless stress;I work in an emotionally draining field of work and have struggled with anxiety my entire life. I’m at a point where I feel trapped, hopeless, and exhausted. I focus on simply making it through the week and find that the only thing I want to do is sleep. When something small goes wrong at work I feel like it pushes me over the edge and I’m ready to snap due to all the built up stress, anxiety and frustration. I often fantasize about breaking a limb or having a medical emergency that would prevent me from going to work. Can anyone relate?;Feeling trapped in endless stress I work in an emotionally draining field of work and have struggled with anxiety my entire life.

Dealing with others Angers is Stressing me;Right now, at this moment I'm feeling very stressed and afraid because a lot of things in my life recently have happened, and i have come to the point where people always scream at me, people always explode in anger when I don't agree with them on or when we are in a disagreement and lately this is happening to me so many times in so many different situations I'm beginning to feel insecure and really stressed and traumatized by the reoccurring situations. I just wanted to know your opinions on how should I deal with people that are very explosive very aggressive and how should I do with the idea that this will happen again and how can I deal with this, even when it's unavoidable.

Stress from browsing the internet;So for the past few weeks I had stopped browsing online, and had put restrictions upon my self and my devices. The two weeks were very productive but now I found another way to go online and being back on reddit and Youtube increased my stress levels and caused me to be unproductive. Is there no way to cure this addiction?

Does anybody else have a friend/or S.O. that is a good friend you've had a long time, but every text conversation usually ends up with you feeling drained, irritated, and in a really bad mood?;Alright I'll try not to make this super long ... so basically I have been really good friends with someone for like 5 years and is always there for me to turn to when I need his help and will do about anything that I may ask always has my back etc. I really value him and how he always helps me to not worry because he will never let me down...but I feel like every conversation, for lack of a more fitting word..that he is constantly cutting me off even before I get a chance to respond before he starts talking again dominating the whole conversation and bombards me text after text after text not giving me any time to reply to anything and if I do get a message in, it doesn't make much difference on what I'm feeling and trying to get across and it's only after he sends 4-5 texts before mine shows up in the thread before what I said was acknowledged and addressed and then after it's briefly talked about then he again just talks and talks and sends numerous texts in a row and won't fucking shutup until I get to the point of overwhelming anger taking full control over me and then I end up having an anxiety attack that doesn't end for at least 30mnz after I have cussed him out ,or attempted to and completely cut off wasting one more minute of time and quit the conversation for good feeling drained of everything and out of energy. Sorry this was a little longer than I expected and I hope makes sense because it's been a long really bad day and I'm trying to come across as able to make sense of.

Beirut Explosion ended me;First off I'm a lebanese 24 years old and You can't imagine the life I'm living here. Our house got destroyed in the beirut explosion and my dad got injured. My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. My father is unemployed too. We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago.

My insights on my stress and how I handle it.;I'm recovering of a burn out and I'm learning more about myself. **Measuring** I have noticed I've got 4 points where I can measure my stress - Physical - Mental - Emotional - My motivation and perseverance When I'm stressed - Physically I just get pains everywhere when my body is in stress. My muscles ache or problems with my bowel. - Mentally I have no concentration to do normal thinking, analysing or problem solving. Watching/reading/listen is just a no go. - Emotionally I cry often when an emotion pops up. I can't control my emotions, they take over. - My motivation/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, I can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things I want or need to do are just out of the question. When I'm in this fase I'm out. I just can sleep, I walk because I need to and I'm happy my parents provide me with food. **Making my own stress thermometer** I made a chart where I put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it - RED burn out tired_face - ORANGE stressed confounded_face - YELLOW minor stressed disappointed_face - GREEN peaceful relieved_face In every cell I put indicators. For example when I'm in yellow I can still watch a new movie, but not in orange, but usually not fully just about an hour. In orange I loose motivation. This way I can track my daily stress level. **Origin of my stress** I know I have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest. It feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness. Actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations. **How I plan to recover** I'm resting right now, I'm lucky I get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave. Daily I rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, I try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which I know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard. I'm mindful, I meditate and I'm very aware of my emotions. When they pop up I try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions. When they pop up when I need to make a difficult choice I choose rationally for my wellbeing. Rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional). Even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions I get not listening to my beliefs and expectations. I'm not helping anybody when I can't even do things for myself! After making a choices like this I get proud of myself because I choose me partying_face **Motivation and perseverance** I have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again grinning_face_with_big_eyes So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.;My insights on my stress and how I handle it.

I don't enjoy being... human;Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better. I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree). I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job. And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff. In my country there is a cult of working your ass off. If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor. Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live.

Question;"This is relatively new to me. Over the past six month i have been very stressed. Though i have been experiencing something that is weird; i have been going to the toilet much more frequently, depending on the stress level. On some very stressful days i would have to urinate more than 12 times. Is that a stress related issue? Ive come to the conclusion that it is, since, ive done multiple tests and check ups to rule out any physical problems. Is anyone experiencing the same issue?";"Question This is relatively new to me.

Money and Mother;So today I’m stressing and having a painful headache. Today my whole family says I’m “codo” (Mexican street word of saying cheap) that it hurts for me to spend money on my mother. Which is half true it hurts but I at least give her something like right now I’ve been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when I bought her pans because she needed pans. But this week I failed for her birthday because i didn’t willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna (because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so I said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if I was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal) that my mom wanted. They say I’m cheap but I always buy stuff that my family likes even though yeah hurts me but if they want it I will buy it. Right now I guess this is me just to vent. I don’t know what to do to prove to my parents that I’m not cheap and that I have been buying stuff willingly for my mother. My father says I still have Mother’s Day and Christmas to do it correctly I guess. But for today my moms birthday I got her a necklace that said mom and a birthday card. It stresses me out because they say that I haven’t changed but I feel like I’ve doing very small baby steps in changing this bad characteristic of me but they expect me to drastically change because I guess it’s a habit that they never taught me to break at a young age. I don’t think I’m a penny pincher but I know it hurts when my bank account goes down but I mean I know my mom would do the same for me in buying stuff that I would like. I’m horrible with presents and sometimes I wish my mom could give me strong hints in what she wants and give me an idea what to give her. But can someone help out on how to change this habit and prove my parents I’m not a cheapskate on my mom for special occasions or when she is wanting them. And how can I be more aware on what she wants.;Money and Mother So today I’m stressing and having a painful headache. Today my whole family says I’m “codo” (Mexican street word of saying cheap) that it hurts for me to spend money on my mother. Which is half true it hurts but I at least give her something like right now I’ve been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when I bought her pans because she needed pans. But this week I failed for her birthday because i didn’t willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna (because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so I said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if I was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal) that my mom wanted.

I've lost my best friend;I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half. My best friend and boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me that we would be taking a short break for his mental health, I know how hard life can be and that his situation also sucked so I after many a tear went a long with it, even though I felt it was a little over board. I love this man with all my heart and soul and I hoped that he would be okay as I know his depression episodes get bad when not delt with quick and I was always there to help when available. After a few weeks I tried texting a few friends (one thing you must know about me is I'm not very popular and don't have many friends and just started at a new school) one friend helped me out the best they could but recently have just trailed off and left me here... during this time, not only was my family involved in so much crap on both sides but many a family member are sick, my car legitimately broke down, my phone broke itself, and I have no one who really is there for me. I'm all alone now... It feels so difficult to do anything, even get up. Now that I've lost my best friend in the whole world after going through so many other trammatic relationships (I was abused in 2 other relationships) I feel like a waste of a person. I feel like him saying he's coming back is a lie that he told me to maybe give me a false since of hope and happiness, but then again I don't know... I really want to believe what he's saying is true but it's almost been 2 months now. I really just feel like my feelings have been disregarded and that I'm always the one who cares the most about everyone, now that they're all gone I don't feel okay... I feel so lonely... I just want my best friend back...I know reddit is a strange place to go with this but I have no good options left and the people here seem like they're pretty chill. Anyways, that's my story...;I've lost my best friend I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half.

Feeling very stressed out lately?;Hi, i need to vent a little bit. I started a job at an Amazon Fulfillment center in November 2018. Anyways, I am at my wits end with this job. I am not really good at what I do their and they know that (I cant for the life of me pick 400 items an hour due to all the jams I get or pod gapping but its always my fault). I got sent home early two days ago because “i suck”. I even got asked if I like the job I have and the process assistant complained to me no matter how much they help out I dont improve. It hurts. Even though I moved out and have enough money to last until I get another job I have lined up I asked my mom her opinion on quitting but she tells me I should stay only because I need the health insurance until I can get on my fiancés in October (when we get married) then quit but she feels bad for me since I am going crazy. I should be working right now but the bus was too packed and skipped my stop( i dont drive). What should I do? Just quit? Listen to my mom?I know I need health insurance and the job pays well but like I said I am at my wits end with everything. This is the worst place I worked for. I know another place to apply for insurance thats near where I live(i already enquired information from them if I was to get that insurance) l, I already have another job I can get more days added until this other new job I am getting calls me for orientation class (they want to hire a few more people to have a full class) Im literally end up crying thinking about going in and I feel like quitting is wrong but like I said I cant take it no more.;Feeling very stressed out lately?

This shadowed figure, he follows me everywhere. I don't know if its a friend or a foe, But he is making my life a mess...He won't leave me alone.;"Since birth I have seen this...""**Figure.**"" It was as young as me and the more years I lived, the bigger it became and the more it learned. It was a black and grey figure, bright grey eyes, its arms thin with sharp claws, and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been. It appeared more frequently every passing day. I told people about it, but nobody wished to believe me. When I told people, they responded with ""*Well, does this 'thing' have a name? If its so real, it must have one.*"" Sadly, I didn't know its name, but one day I built the courage to ask it. I met it in a forest by my house, in private, I asked for its name and why it was always following me. He came close to me and spoke to me. ""*I go by many names,* ***Sadness, Despair, Depression.*** *But in your case, call me...****Autism****.""* Autism said he was connected to me since birth, an accidental life. Back then, I thought he was just a person nobody understood like me, so I let him stay with me. But now, Autism has almost ruined my life. He began forcing me to be different. Separating me from people I cared about and those who cared for me. I didn't believe I could save myself from him. He always held me close, trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones. He used them whenever he wished, and made me a puppet. Whenever he took me over I became ***Aggressive, Harmful, Dangerous.*** I always begged him to leave me alone, but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together. One day, I had had enough. I finally faced the shadow that took me over, and I ***reconciled*** with it. I knew it wouldn't leave, even if I told it to. I asked for it to try and change, to listen to me, to help me become unique, to help me be normal, not a monster, ***to make me a person.*** He stared back at me, and apologized to everything he had done, he had just wanted me to act his way. We spoke until we finally reached an agreement. I had thought my life was turning around. I was making friends, Becoming active, succeeding in school. Although he would return to his habits sometimes, he kept his word and had become a friend of my own. When I introduced people to him some weren't impressed, but most liked him and thought he was interesting. It was working out...until now... I had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life, because of the events the world is facing. But it ended up being the following year, 2021. My Mother had not been in the greatest of conditions. She was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides. She was getting better every day, to a point where we could take her back home. (She stayed on a hospital bed at the house though.) I was going to high school one day, when my step dad told me he had the Virus. We lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents, so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better, taking care of my Mother who was still at the house. My Grandparents told me we were going back to check on them, Autism was really nervous about what would happen, but I ignored him. We got there and we said hello to them. Then our stepdad told us the worst news ever, our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week. I was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen, I was already prepared for this, my brother wasn't as much. So today was the day we would say goodbye to her. I won't go into much detail about here, but when we left back to our Grandparents house. I went upstairs and saw Autism sitting on the bed, Sad. I tried to comfort him. Every time I was about to cry, he would tell me ""Crying will not help, its hard to keep the sadness in, but do not shed tears for anybody in front of anybody. It will only make it worse."" These events on my Mom have happened a few days ago, and is about to pass away. I will also state that I am 14 years old and is confessing this here because I need help...I don't know if I should listen to him or not, I really want to let all my emotions out.

I can't sleep at night anymore;So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any< I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works. ;I can't sleep at night anymore So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more.

I have no sleep.;Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly. But there was this project I had for the design course that took me the whole Christmas break to do. (I only had 2 weeks of that break) Since it was a plushie project, my teacher expects us to have a sewing machine at home. I didn't have one so I sew it all by hand. I would stay up until 6 am to work on it then wake up at 8 am to sew again, by doing all of that myself I pushed back all of my other units for my other course and now I have fallen behind a lot.. I would always make a schedule for my day but then I have interruptions such as how my mom would get mad at me for not getting my work on time then goes on to say she's gonna take my electronics away? IDK she's gonna make me fail either way if she ever does that again. Then I have a boyfriend that I've been with for a year and a few months now, in October 2020 he did a suicide attempt and I felt so useless not being there in person. Which of course I broke down, didn't do my work for the whole night, didn't eat anything, and when my mom walked into my room when I had my break down and she made a happy expression that I broke up with him. I told her about it and she didn't care and left my room. 2 hours later he was alive and well and I felt relieved but now I feel more paranoid that he would do that again. People say that taking breaks is good when you're stressed. But I can't take any breaks, I'm behind in my subjects and I only have this week and 3 more weeks until I have to move on to the next quadmester. After that, outstanding work from that unit will become a 0.;I have no sleep. Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly.

Managing stressful situations that are actually very important?;I have a company that deals with wholesale international trade. Anyone who has ever bought something online already knows how much things can get delayed. If your Amazon Prime toothbrush gets delayed a day, whatever shrug it off right? What if your girlfriend's birthday present is lost or stuck in customs? A little more frustrating right? Now what if your entire shipment of tens of thousands of perishable goods is a week late while all your competitors start getting theirs? That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about. It's easy to say just don't dwell on the things that are out of control. Don't ruminate on the problems and instead focus on solutions... Etc. But when it's a pretty impactful event in your life with potential long term consequences it's easier said than done. I mean logically, in theory having negative thoughts about said event does nothing to change the outcome. But am I really supposed to be able to act all Zen when I'm potentially going to be out thousands of dollars? Lost sales, damages reputation, potential lost customers, etc.;Managing stressful situations that are actually very important? I have a company that deals with wholesale international trade.

Exam season stress management;Tldr CBD eased my exam stress I'm a huge exam stresser, I get major anxiety and I feel like shit the weeks leading up to exams and finals. Last year I was taking some CBD oil for pain management, and noticed I was way less stressed about my tests than usual. I guessed that I had just gotten over a lot of the reasons I would usually get anxious about but now this year I'm not on CBD anymore and my stress levels are back up to my pre-cbd times. I found [this]( article so now I believe that CBD was actually why I felt better, now I'm ready to get back taking CBD to hopefully alleviate some of the exam stress that I'm feeling...

How do you cope with spiraling? I need help;Everytime i think about work, i start to get blocked and start to spiral with anxiety. My brain just starts to get so stressed i start to get disturbing intrusive images that will make me go get distracted so i can stop having them, but that doesnt make any of my work disappear, so of course that will make me accumulate work and then have to either work for weeks without rest or have a breakdown and fail on my projects. When i overwork myself, its to a point where i will need to rest for several days after, which can make me go to the ''get distracted and avoid doing work'' phase because my brain just doesnt want to go through several days like that again.

Long, but need advice on money stress;My husband and I of 25 years want to move to Vancouver Island. His mom lives there and is not doing well. Our 23 year old daughter lives with us but she doesn't want to move with us. We have decided to purchase a 5th wheel and live in it on the Island. We live in a 2800sq ft house and have to downsize. We are drowning in debt because my husband hasn't worked much since the pandemic hit. Our bills are all behind including our rent by 4 months. We are posting items to sell online, people just aren't buying anything!

His mom lives there and is not doing well. Our 23 year old daughter lives with us but she doesn't want to move with us. We have decided to purchase a 5th wheel and live in it on the Island. We live in a 2800sq ft house and have to downsize. We are drowning in debt because my husband hasn't worked much since the pandemic hit. Our bills are all behind including our rent by 4 months.

Do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred;Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened.;Do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred Happens to me a lot.

it’s so weird how parents swear they know you better than you know yourself but can’t see when you’re not happy;It’s been so bad lately. My sleep schedule is completely fucked. The lower left corner of my bed is full of trash and I can’t toss and turn in my bed without feeling a crumb. I don’t leave my room unless it’s to get food or see my mom because she works from home all day. I haven’t changed clothes in a week. At least I’m showering and brushing my teeth and stuff. That’s become a habit ever since I got two cavities from not doing so in a month. It’s like I don’t want to talk about it because I hate talking about it. I just want to go to the doctor get a therapist or some shit and never talk to my family about anything like it. Because I’ve still got doubts whether I have depression or I’m just lazy and a shitty person.;it’s so weird how parents swear they know you better than you know yourself but can’t see when you’re not happy It’s been so bad lately.

Keep my memory from being poor when I'm stressed?;I have an amazing memory and can think on my feet in most situations. Until I'm late for something (appointment, meet a friend, a date once). Then I don't remember anything. I'll even go the wrong directions out of habit and not catch it for 10 or even 20 minutes. Occasionally when people are mad at me I'll often not remember anything, like if a problem happens I don't even remember that I took steps to avoid it and think it's completely my fault when it was an accident or someone elses mistakes, even when I mention those steps in writing. I hate not being able to remember things when I'm stressed. I sometimes won't even remember facts until a day or two later if it was stressful enough.

Wondering if there's anyone here who has experienced the same as me, and managed to make a recovery and get their life together.;The title. Some years ago I had to drop out of school due to chronic fatigue. Cue life falling apart. Diagnosed with depression and some other mental health conditions. Depression and anxiety has controlled my life for as long as I can remember. Recently, I got the chance to go to a college, study art and basic subjects I missed out on. Literally the perfect chance for happiness, I could meet new people, study what I love. My anxiety once again fucked me and I failed to go. I have another chance for a place on the course next year, but a year is a long time when you have nothing to do all day and no one to talk to. Idek if I will make it to the next year at this rate.;Wondering if there's anyone here who has experienced the same as me, and managed to make a recovery and get their life together. The title.

Woman gets sexually assaulted at work. Nobody cares.;As described I am going through the worst disappointment of my life. A woman gave a Witten complaint to hr that one of the partners basically just did everything to her but pull his dick out. He also did the same to numerous other women. It’s covered up. I was told to relax. Everyone knows. Nobody is outraged. My fellow “feminist” colleague won’t even acknowledge it. The worst isn’t men perpetuating. It’s women approving of the actions and siding with men. I’m so fucked from this lately that I am barely functioning. I’m not eating or sleeping. I haven’t slept unmedicated in months. If I don’t take meds I am up til 5-6 without fail. Directly caused by this. Oh their solution? Yea they just moved his office next to mine. I hold pee in so I don’t have to go outside my door. I’m going to be quitting obviously in a few months and this will be fully disclosed to the stakeholders as to why. But my god. What the fuck. How’s this real life.

My 3 month hiatus after a mental breakdown is about to end;I've always been depressed/anxious for as long as I can remember, but this past year, my mental health has been at a severe all time low. I quit my really great job 3 months ago because I had a mental breakdown and literally felt like I was going crazy and couldn't handle anything at all. I've always been work motivated and have never not had a job since I was a teenager (I'm 30 now.) The last 3 months have been incredibly difficult to say the least. I've been seeing a therapist and I've tried 9 different antidepressants/antipsychotics in the last like 6 months. Nothing has helped. I sleep most of the day every day. I haven't needed hospitization thankfully, however my husband and I have definitely discussed the possibility of me needing to be admitted and there have been times that I was very close to going. I've had to have him hide my propanolol (I take as needed for panic attacks/anxiety) because I was suicidal and fantasizing about overdosing. I just started Trintellix (in addition to Lamictal) about 2 weeks ago. For the first week or two of taking most of the medications I've tried, it has always seemed to help at least a little bit. I'm assuming that's just a placebo effect because I want it to help so badly. But they always stop helping and I go back to my bedridden, severely depressed self. The last week or so, I've actually felt better than I have in the last few months. I'm not 100% of course and I still have a hard time getting myself motivated to do shit, but I actually feel like there is a possibility of me being able to get things done. I feel like there is a 150 lb weight on top of me instead of a 200 lb weight on top of me. I'm really, REALLY scared it's not going to last like all the rest of the medications though. Long story short, I finally got a job. A good one that I'm excited about. I start in 20 days. I'm looking back at the last few months and looking at how I'm feeling now. I really really want to start this job while feeling at least okay. I know that once the excitement of the job passes, the depression will probably creep back up, but I'm hoping it'll be at least manageable. I don't want to fuck it up and have to stop working again. I'm trying to think of ways I can prepare mentally before I start- what kind of habits I should try to start getting into ahead of time so I don't find myself too overwhelmed and unable to handle anything. I've been so severely depressed the last 3 months and I'm not going to be able to stay in bed all day when I start this job. It's going to be exhausting if I don't make changes now. Anyone have any advice, ideas, encouragement?

Do people still use stress balls and the like to relieve stress?;I deal with an extreme amount of stress on what seems like a daily basis. When I was younger, I remember that I was given a squishy stress ball that I could squeeze in my hand for when I was in special help for my ADHD. It helped ground myself a little and I'm thinking it can help me in moments of extreme stress. Does anyone still use stress balls or similar equipment? Do you recommend using them, and what do you use? Edit minor clarification;Do people still use stress balls and the like to relieve stress?

Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?;For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first. My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me. My doctor’s visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately, they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral. I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal part-time money to pay for whatever else. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked up by my parents. I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?;Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?
